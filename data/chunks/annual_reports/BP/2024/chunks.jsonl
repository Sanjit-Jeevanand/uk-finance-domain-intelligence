For 2022-24, performance share awards below board had a\ndifferent scorecard to executive directors, which resulted in an outcome of 73% of maximum.\nOverview of single figure outcomes\nSalary\nOn 12 September 2023, Murray Auchincloss was appointed as CEO on an interim basis and his base pay was set at \u00a31.45 million. This remained\nunchanged upon appointment to CEO on 17 January 2024. Kate Thomson was appointed CFO on 2 February 2024 and her base pay was set at \u00a3800,000.\nGiven their recent appointments, neither executive director received an increase in respect of 2024 as part of the annual salary review.\nBenefits\nExecutive directors received car-related benefits, coverage of tax return preparation, security assistance, insurance and medical cover.\nMurray Auchincloss\u2019s taxable benefits materially decreased year-on-year due to the phasing out of transitional car-related benefits as reported in the 2023\ndirectors\u2019 remuneration report.\nCash allowance in lieu of pension\nIn line with the 2023 directors\u2019 remuneration policy, executive directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 20% of salary.

Our strategy has continued\nto evolve and update and the criteria we set back at the start of the performance period (2022) to judge progress do not fully reflect current expectations.\nAlongside assessment against three key pillars (established in 2022), the committee have also taken a broader review of the shareholder experience over\nthe performance period. Further, there has been consideration of mid-cycle changes we have experienced during the performance period, such as bp\u2019s\nupdated transition strategy in February 2023 and the key strategic initiatives during 2024 which have laid our foundation for growth. In summary:\n\u2022 Resilient hydrocarbons: Performed well across the board, with strong production delivery, plant reliability\u00ab and unit costs. This was offset by\noperational challenges during the period which primarily impacted refining availability\u00ab. Ultimately, financial performance was strong against this pillar.\n\u2022 Low carbon energy: Progress was mixed with a number of key initiatives completed as management adapted to our evolving strategy and tough\nmarket conditions.\n\u2022 Convenience and mobility: bp performed well across our suite of volume measures, but a very challenging market meant financial delivery was lower\nthan expected.\nOverall performance: During the period, bp has achieved a number of strategic milestones \u2013 particularly in the last year of the performance period \u2013 and is\nwell positioned to drive future growth.\n1.

The two cash measures;\nmodified free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow CAGR are different, with the former covering a holistic view of in-year cash generation (including working capital\nand proceeds) and the latter representing underlying free cash flow growth, removing more volatile items, in line with our external targets. The ROACE measure now\nfully aligns with our external targets with measurement at the end of 2027.\nFor strategic progress, the measure will remain subject to the committee\u2019s judgement at the end of the three-year period. The judgement of performance will take\ninto account progress against the financial targets set under our reset strategy \u2013 including reference to measures such as divestments, net debt\u00ab and structural\ncost reductions.

In respect of the former CEO, the calculation has been based on\nthe total single figure excluding the impact of malus and clawback in order to provide a comparison with prior years. Appropriate pro-rating of fixed and variable pay has been applied.\nc Share price for the CEO share plan vesting has been based on the average share price over Q4 of the 2024 FY of \u00a33.90.\nThis is our sixth year reporting the CEO pay ratio following the requirements introduced in 2018. As per the past five years, we have selected Option A as\nour reporting basis, being the most accurate approach available, and we confirm that no broadly applicable components of pay have been omitted. Where\nnecessary, full-time equivalent pay has been calculated by simple engrossment of part-year values. Employee values relate to pay and benefits for the year\nended 31 December 2024.\nChanges in the pay ratio over time reflect the fact that CEO remuneration is more heavily weighted to variable pay, resulting in larger year-on-year swings\nthan wider workforce pay. This is evidenced by the variability of the CEO pay ratio over the past six years. This volatility in the pay ratio reporting from year\nto year is expected, and illustrates one of the challenges in commenting on whether the pay differentials are appropriate. In 2024, the 50th percentile pay\nratio decreased from 103:1 to 74:1. This was largely driven by the outcomes of the CEO\u2019s variable awards, with the lowest bonus outcome in the past 10\nyears (excluding nil bonus for 2020) and the performance share award being granted at a lower multiple of salary when he was in position as CFO.\nThe committee believes in performance-based remuneration. For all employees eligible to participate in the annual cash bonus plan, there is an individual\nuplift available each year which allows managers to nominate individuals based on their personal contributions during the year. For senior leaders, a\nsignificant portion of the remuneration package continues to be linked to performance-based reward. It is therefore the view of the committee that the\nremuneration frameworks we have in place for executive directors and the wider workforce are fit-for-purpose and deliver pay outcomes appropriate to the\ncircumstances of the year, with differentials that reflect the relative contributions made at different levels of the organization.\nThe committee is satisfied that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with bp\u2019s pay policies for employees and does not constitute a reason\nto modify our pay programmes.\nPercentage change comparisons: directors\u2019 remuneration versus employees\nIn the table below, values in column \u2018a\u2019 represent the percentage change in salary and fees; values in column \u2018b\u2019 represent the percentage change in taxable\nbenefits; and values in column \u2018c\u2019 represent the percentage change in bonus outcomes for performance periods in respect of each financial year. For the\npurposes of comparison, the employee percentages shown below represent the relative change between the median full-time equivalent pay for every\nemployee employed at BP p.l.c. at any point during the relevant financial year, and the equivalent median value for the preceding financial year. Where\nincreases are infinite relative to the preceding year, we have shown them as 100% for illustration, where a director was appointed or retired part-way\nthrough the year we have annualized pay except for one-time items, and where comparison to the prior year is not possible we have used dashes.\n2024 vs. 2023 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020 2020 vs. 2019\nPercentage change for: a b c a b c a b c a b c a b c\nEmployees 4 % 0 % -65 % 6 % 1 % 4 % 2 % 1 % 45 % 7 % -9 % 100 % 0 % 0 % -100 %\nMurray Auchincloss 43 % -61 % -60 % 30 % 283 % 31 % 7 % 530 % 3 % 5 % 5 % 100 % \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nKate Thomson \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nDame Amanda Blanc 24 % -72 % n/a 38 % 100 % n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a\nPamela Daley 3 % -75 % n/a 2 % 2 % n/a 7 % 43 % n/a 4 % 1385 % n/a -15 % -92 % n/a\nHelge Lund (chair) 4 % -43 % n/a 3 % 78 % n/a 0 % 97 % n/a 0 % -24 % n/a 0 % -74 % n/a\nMelody Meyer -1 % -68 % n/a 2 % -14 % n/a 13 % 139 % n/a -4 % 283 % n/a 9 % -77 % n/a\nTushar Morzaria 9 % -73 % n/a 2 % -46 % n/a 25 % 100 % n/a 5 % 0 % n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a\nHina Nagarajan 13 % -46 % n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a\nSatish Pai 3 % -88 % n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a\nPaula Rosput Reynolds 3 % -70 % n/a 2 % -14 % n/a 16 % 145 % n/a \u2014 228 % n/a 2 % -92 % n/a\nKaren Richardson -5 % -12 % n/a 11 % -20 % n/a 30 % 96 % n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a\nSir John Sawers 3 % 63 % n/a 2 % 105 % n/a 17 % 1 % n/a \u2014 1588 % n/a \u2014 -83 % n/a\nJohannes Teyssen 7 % -68 % n/a 3 % 12 % n/a 21 % 65 % n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a \u2014 \u2014 n/a", "page_start": 109, "page_end": 111, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Further detail on the activities of the committee in 2024 is set out in the remuneration committee report on page 88.\nDuring 2024 Ben Mathews, who was employed by the company and reported to the chair of the board, acted as secretary to the remuneration committee.\nThe committee also received advice on various matters relating to the remuneration of executive directors and senior management from Kerry Dryburgh,\nEVP people, culture & communications and Ashok Pillai, SVP reward.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) continued to provide independent advice to the committee in 2024. PwC advice included, for example, support with\nremuneration benchmarking and updates on market practice. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operates under the\ncode of conduct in relation to executive remuneration in the UK. The committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent. The\ncommittee is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team who provide remuneration advice to the committee do not have connections with\nthe company or its directors that may impair their independence.\nTotal fees or other charges (based on an hourly rate) for the provision of remuneration advice to the committee in 2024 (save in respect of legal advice)\nwere \u00a388,751 to PwC. Freshfields LLP (Freshfields) provided legal advice on specific compliance matters to the committee. PwC and Freshfields provide\nother advice in their respective areas to the group.\nConsiderations related to the UK Corporate Governance Code\nWhen setting the 2023 policy, the committee concluded that a scorecard-based approach to setting targets and measuring outcomes helps it to engage\ntransparently with shareholders and the wider workforce on remuneration. Thus, bp continues to operate a simple, clear structure of market-aligned salary\nwith annual and three-year performance-based incentives. Risks are managed through careful setting of performance measures and targets and the\ncommittee retains the exercise of its discretion in assessing outcomes. These are complemented with robust malus and clawback measures.\nRemuneration outcomes are predictable, as shown in the implementation charts of the 2023 policy, and proportional by virtue of the challenging\nperformance levels required to achieve target pay outcomes. Through material weighting in measures related to safety, sustainability and strategy, as\nshown on page 104, remuneration aligns closely with bp\u2019s culture, as expressed through our purpose and ambition.\nShareholder engagement\nThroughout 2024 the committee engaged frequently on remuneration policy and approach with bp\u2019s largest shareholders, as well as their representative\nbodies. This dialogue will continue throughout 2025.

The financial reporting framework\nthat has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom accounting standards, including\nFRS 101 \u2018Reduced Disclosure Framework\u2019 (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice).\n2. Basis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those\nstandards are further described in the auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\nWe are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial\nstatements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s (the \u2018FRC\u2019s\u2019) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have\nfulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the group and parent company for the\nyear are disclosed in Note 36 to the financial statements.\nWe confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard to the group or the parent company, with the\nexception of Deloitte UAE providing an additional service of rolling forward a BP p.l.c.\u2019s subsidiary\u2019s financial statements. The service was administrative in\nnature and there were no calculations or judgements applied when carrying out this exercise. In our opinion, based on no fees being charged for the\nservices and the size of the component, the impact of providing the services was immaterial and inconsequential, however this is a breach, albeit\ninsignificant, of the Ethical Standard. Following investigation, we have concluded in agreement with the Audit Committee that given the size of the services\nprovided and their potential impact, as well as the safeguards in place, our objectivity and impartiality has not been impaired, and we believe that a\nreasonable and informed third party with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that we are capable of exercising objective\nand impartial judgement on all matters related to the audit.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.", "page_start": 115, "page_end": 118, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Summary of our audit approach\nKey audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:\n\u2022 potential impact of climate change and the energy transition\n\u2022 impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets\n\u2022 decommissioning provisions\n\u2022 valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition, and\n\u2022 management override of controls.\nIn the current year, we re-considered whether the accounting for complex transactions remains a key audit matter. While the\ngroup continues to enter into such transactions, these transactions have significantly reduced in magnitude compared with the\nprior year. Consequently, accounting for these transactions was not included as a key audit matter, as they do not have a material\nimpact on the group's financial statements. We designed and performed audit procedures relative to the risk levels determined\nthrough the application of our consistent framework for evaluating complex transactions. These procedures were adjusted, as\nnecessary, based on the nature, scale, and complexity of the transactions assessed during the year.\nAll other key audit matters are consistent with those we identified in the prior year and the developments in fact patterns of these\npreviously identified key audit matters are explained in the respective sections below.\nMateriality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was $800 million (2023 $1,000 million) which was determined\nbased on cash flow from operations and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.\nWe adopted a different basis to determine materiality used to audit the group financial statements this year due to the impact of\nchanging macroeconomic conditions, one-off transactions and strategic decisions on the group\u2019s profit before tax. In the prior\nyear we determined materiality based on profit before tax and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.\nScoping Our scope covered 178 consolidation units (cons units). Of these, 153 were subject to audits of specified account balances and 25\nwere subject to specified audit procedures by the component audit teams or group audit team. These covered 69% of revenue,\n73% of PP&E and 72% of profit before tax. The remaining 765 cons units were subject to other procedures, including performing\nanalytical reviews, making inquiries of management, and evaluating and testing management's group-wide controls.\n4. Conclusions relating to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial\nstatements is appropriate.\nOur evaluation of the directors\u2019 assessment of the group\u2019s and parent company\u2019s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting\nincluded:\n\u2022 assessing the financing facilities including the nature of the facilities and repayment terms;\n\u2022 assessing whether the impact of potential margin calls in respect of derivative exchange contracts used to risk manage the physical portfolio has been\nappropriately considered given price volatility;\n\u2022 assessing management\u2019s identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going concern assessment;\n\u2022 testing the clerical accuracy of the going concern model;\n\u2022 assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management;\n\u2022 performing our independent sensitivity analysis; and\n\u2022 assessing the disclosures made within the financial statements.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively,\nmay cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when\nthe financial statements are authorised for issue.\nIn relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in\nrelation to the directors\u2019 statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of\naccounting.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n5. Key audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current\nyear and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included\nthose which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\nThroughout the course of our audit, we identify risks of material misstatement (\u2018risks\u2019). We consider both the likelihood of a risk and the potential\nmagnitude of a misstatement in making the assessment. Certain risks are classified as \u2018significant\u2019 or \u2018higher\u2019 depending on their severity. The category of\nthe risk determines the level of evidence we seek in providing assurance that the associated financial statement item is not materially misstated.\nThe matters described below were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we\ndo not provide a separate opinion on these matters.", "page_start": 118, "page_end": 119, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

It represents a strategic challenge and a key focus of\nmanagement. The related risks that we have assessed for our audit are as follows:\n\u2022 Forecast assumptions used in assessing the value-in-use of oil and gas PP&E assets within bp\u2019s balance sheet for\nimpairment testing, particularly oil and gas price assumptions and their interrelationship with forecast emissions costs,\nmay not appropriately reflect changes in supply and demand due to climate change and the energy transition (see\n\u2018Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets\u2019 below).\n\u2022 The timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures in respect of oil and gas assets may need to be brought\nforward with a resulting increase in the present value of the associated liabilities due to the impact of climate change.\nIn addition, there is an exposure to decommissioning obligations that may revert back to bp in respect of assets\ntransferred to third parties through historical divestments. The risk of exposure is increased due to the impacts of\nclimate change which have heightened long term financial resilience concerns for many industry participants.\nFurthermore, provisions for decommissioning refining assets, not generally recognised on the basis that the potential\nobligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions\nin demand due to climate change curtail their operational lives (see \u2018Decommissioning provisions\u2019 below).\n\u2022 The recoverability of certain of the group\u2019s $4.4 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised as at 31\nDecember 2024 (2023 $4.3 billion) is potentially exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors\n(see Note 15). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed as a consequence of the energy\ntransition or lower forecast future oil and gas prices. The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be\nwritten off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex and continues to require\nsignificant management judgement.\n\u2022 The useful economic lives of the group\u2019s refining assets may be shortened as society moves towards \u2018net zero\u2019\nemissions targets and bp seeks to achieve its net zero ambition, such that the depreciation charge is materially\nunderstated. Of the total refining assets carried in the balance sheet, all but an immaterial residual value relating\nprimarily to land and buildings will be fully depreciated by 2050. As disclosed in Note 1 to the accounts on page 146,\nmanagement has concluded that demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient for the existing\nrefineries to continue operating for the duration of their remaining useful lives and hence no changes to the useful\neconomic lives of its refinery assets were required.\n\u2022 The carrying value of bp\u2019s refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and\ndemand which arise among other things as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Management\nidentified impairment indicators in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany during the year and, as a result, an\nimpairment test was performed to assess the recoverability of the Gelsenkirchen refinery carrying value. As disclosed\nin Note 4 to the accounts on page 166 management has recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 billion (2023 $1.3\nbillion) in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery, primarily driven by changes in economic assumptions. At 31 December\n2024 management identified an impairment indicator for all of its other refineries due to a reduction in the local marker\nmargins. The impairment tests performed by management to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of these\nrefineries did not result in any additional impairment charges being recognised.\n\u2022 The total goodwill balance as at 31 December 2024 is $14.9 billion (2023 $12.5 billion), of which $7.2 billion relates to\nupstream oil and gas assets (2023 $7.0 billion). The carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable as a\nconsequence of climate change and therefore may need to be impaired. For oil production & operations (\u2018OP&O\u2019) and\ngas & low carbon energy (\u2018G&LCE\u2019), goodwill is allocated to hydrocarbon CGUs in aggregate at the respective segment\nlevel. Goodwill related to low carbon energy investments is held separately within the G&LCE segment. The most\nsignificant assumption in the hydrocarbon related goodwill impairment tests affected by climate change relates to\nfuture oil and gas prices (see \u2018Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets\u2019 below). Given the significant level of\nheadroom in the goodwill impairment tests, management identified no other assumption that could lead to a material\nmisstatement of goodwill due to the energy transition and other climate change factors. Disclosures in relation to\nsensitivities for goodwill are included within Note 14 on page 179. The customers & products (C&P) segment has a\ngoodwill balance of $5.5 billion (2023 $5.4 billion), of which the most significant element is $2.6 billion relating to the\nCastrol business (2023 $2.7 billion). Notwithstanding the expected global transition to electric vehicles which may\nreduce demand for lubricants, due to the substantial headroom in the most recent impairment test (as described in\nNote 14), management has assessed as remote the likelihood that the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than its\ncarrying value.\n\u2022 Climate change-related litigation brought against bp, as disclosed in Note 33 to the financial statements, may lead to\nan outflow of funds requiring provision.\nSubsequent to the year end, on 26 February 2025 the group announced a strategy reset, with a consequent impact on the\ngroup\u2019s key targets and metrics for 2025 and beyond. This post balance sheet event has been considered by\nmanagement in the context of forecasts and assumptions as they relate to the 2024 financial statements and the matters\nnoted above.\nThe above considerations were a significant focus of management during the period which led to this being a matter that\nwe communicated to the audit committee, and which had a significant effect on the overall audit strategy. We therefore\nidentified this as a key audit matter. This matter was also discussed by the Audit Committee on page 84.\nThT", "page_start": 119, "page_end": 120, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

This matter was also discussed by the Audit Committee on page 84.\nThT\nFinancial statements\nHow the scope of our audit Overall response\nresponded to the key audit\nWe held discussions with management, with our Climate Change specialists and within the group engagement team to\nmatter\nidentify the areas where we felt climate change could have a potential impact on the financial statements.\nWe also continued to utilise a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners and specialists\nwith specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent\nchallenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.\nAudit procedures\nThe audit response related to two of the audit risks identified is set out under the key audit matters for \u2018Impairment of\nupstream oil and gas PP&E assets\u2019 on pages 121-123 and \u2018Decommissioning provisions\u2019 on pages 124-125. Other\nprocedures are as follows:\nIn respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024:\n\u2022 We tested the relevant controls within the group\u2019s E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes.\n\u2022 We challenged and evaluated management\u2019s key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6.\nWhere impairment indicators were identified, we corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for\nassets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital\nallocation decisions, assessing management\u2019s key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting minutes and\nassessing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations\nto renew licences or modify key terms.\nWe challenged management\u2019s assertion that no changes are required to the assessed useful economic lives of refining\nassets as a consequence of climate change factors. In doing this, we obtained third party reports assessing future refined\npetroleum product demand for those countries which are included in our group full audit scope for the C&P segment. In\nparticular, we considered the forecasts as set out in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 which shows that demand for\nrefined petroleum products is expected to remain sufficient for at least the current remaining useful economic lives of the\nrefineries such that current depreciation rates are appropriate, including under the Announced Pledges Scenario which is\nassociated with a temperature rise of 1.7 \u00b0C in 2100 (with a 50% probability).\nWe considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group\u2019s refining portfolio and assessed\ninternal and external market studies of future supply and demand. In relation to the refinery impairment tests performed\nby management, our audit procedures included: evaluating the valuation methodology and testing the integrity and\nmechanical accuracy of the impairment models; assessing the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs to the\nimpairment models, notably forecast local refining marker margins, discount rate and energy input costs, challenging and\nevaluating management\u2019s assumptions by reference to third party data where available and involvement of our valuation\nspecialists; and evaluating management\u2019s ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results\nwith historical forecasts and tested management\u2019s internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.\nWe performed procedures to satisfy ourselves that, other than future oil and gas price assumptions, there were no other\nassumptions in management\u2019s oil and gas goodwill impairment tests in respect of which reasonably possible changes\ndue to the energy transition and other climate change factors could cause goodwill to be materially misstated. We\nassessed the impact of climate change on C&P segment activities and we have not noted any factors to indicate\nimpairment of goodwill due to climate change.\nWith regard to climate change litigation, we designed procedures specifically to respond to the risks that provisions could\nbe understated or that contingent liability disclosures may be omitted or be inaccurate including:\n\u2022 holding discussions with the group general counsel and other senior bp lawyers regarding climate change matters;\n\u2022 conducting a search for climate change litigation and claims brought against the group;\n\u2022 making written inquiries of, and holding discussions with, external legal counsel advising bp in relation to climate\nchange litigation; and\nWith regard to the consideration of the impact of the post balance sheet strategic announcement by the group, we\nperformed procedures to assess the reasonableness and completeness of management\u2019s analysis as to the impact on\nforecasts and assumptions underpinning the judgements identified above.\ninconsistency between the other information and the financial statements; and (b) whether there was any material\ninconsistency between the other information and our understanding of the business based on audit evidence obtained and\nconclusions reached in the audit.", "page_start": 120, "page_end": 121, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

We did not identify any additional impairments or write-offs from the work we\nperformed.\nWe are satisfied:\n\u2022 with the results of our procedures relating to the carrying value of refining assets and that the impairments recorded\nare reasonable;\n\u2022 with the results of our procedures relating to the assessment of the useful economic lives of refining assets and\ntherefore depreciation charges, based on the market studies we read;\n\u2022 with the sensitivity analysis disclosures around the energy transition and other climate change factors performed in\nrespect of the goodwill balances, and that the group\u2019s goodwill balances are not materially misstated;\n\u2022 with management\u2019s assertion that no provision should currently be made in respect of climate change litigation.

At current rates of depreciation, depletion and amortisation (\u2018DD&A\u2019), the average remaining depreciable life of\nthe upstream oil and gas PP&E (within the OP&O and G&LCE segments) is five years and the refining assets (within the\nC&P segment) is eleven years.\nFinancial statements\n5.2 Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets \u2013 Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements\nKey audit matter description The group balance sheet as at 31 December 2024 includes PP&E of $100 billion (2023 $105 billion), of which $56 billion\n(2023 $62 billion) is oil and gas properties.\nManagement\u2019s best estimate oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised in 2024 as set\nout in Note 1 on page 152, although the revisions were not significant.\nManagement has also determined bp\u2019s \u2018best estimate\u2019 discount rate assumptions, as set out in Note 1 on page 152. bp\u2019s\npost-tax discount rate used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets in 2024 remained unchanged from prior year at\n8% (2023: 8%). Pre-tax discount rates applied in impairment tests were revised in some regions to reflect changes in local\ntax rates and country risk premiums, however the impact of these revisions was insignificant. Reserves estimates for all\noil and gas fields were also reviewed and updated where necessary at year-end.\nManagement judged that in aggregate, the year-end oil and gas price assumption revisions, changes to pre-tax discount\nrates for certain regions due to country risk premium or tax rate changes, and changes to other input assumptions\nincluding reserves reductions on several key fields, all combined to constitute an impairment trigger for all oil and gas\ncash generating units (CGUs). As a result of testing performed during 2024, $2.0 billion (2023 $3.6 billion) of oil and gas\nCGU net impairment charges were recognised, principally due to certain discount rate revisions, an increase in certain\ncapital expenditure forecasts and operating expenditure forecasts and certain reserves write downs.\nWe identified three key management estimates in management\u2019s determination of the level of impairment charge and/or\nimpairment reversal. These are:\nOil and gas prices \u2013 bp\u2019s oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment\nassessments performed across the OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of\nfuture prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the global energy transition, macro-\neconomic factors and disruption in global supply due to ongoing geo-political conflicts. There is a risk that\nmanagement do not forecast reasonable \u2018best estimate\u2019 oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for\nimpairment charge and/or impairment reversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions\nare highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to bp\u2019s oil and gas CGU valuation. There is also a risk that\nmanagement\u2019s oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.\nbp's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in use impairment assessments are aligned with bp\u2019s investment\nappraisal assumptions, except that potential future emissions costs that could be borne by bp are included in\ninvestment appraisals as bp costs without assuming incremental revenue.\nAs described in Note 1 on page 146, emissions costs forecasts interrelate with bp\u2019s oil and gas prices, because\nbp\u2019s price assumptions for value-in-use estimates represent \u2018net producer prices\u2019, i.e., net of any further\nemissions costs that may be enacted in the future. Management\u2019s judgement is that the potential impact of\nsuch further emissions costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact\non bp\u2019s oil and gas CGU carrying values as costs would effectively be borne by oil and gas end users via overall\nhigher commodity prices. There is a risk that management\u2019s judgement is not reasonable.\nDiscount rates \u2013 Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the\ndiscount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in\nthe cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management does not assume reasonable discount rates,\nadjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a\nreasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate\nassumption is also a pervasive input across bp\u2019s oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset\nspecific risks and tax rates.\nReserves and resources estimates \u2013 A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas\nproduction forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development\nassumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to\nproven and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions\nrelated to these volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise\nfrom unreasonable production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of\nsystematic flaws in bp\u2019s reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and G&LCE segments.\nWe identified certain individual CGUs with a total carrying value of $9 billion (2023 $18 billion) which we determined would\nbe most at risk of material impairment charges as a result of a reasonably possible change in the oil and gas price\nassumptions. These CGUs have been subjected to $9 billion worth of previous impairments and as such, are also at risk of\nmaterial impairment reversal resulting from potential oil and gas price assumption changes. We identified that a subset of\nthese CGUs was also individually materially sensitive to the discount rate assumption. Accordingly, we identified these as\nsignificant audit risks.\nWe also identified CGUs with a further $2 billion (2023 $2 billion) of combined carrying value which were less sensitive. We\nidentified these as a higher audit risk as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a\nreasonably possible change in some or all of the key assumptions. No impairment reversals are available for these CGUs.\nFurther information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 153.\nImpairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a key audit\nmatter because recoverable values are reliant on forecast assumptions such as oil and gas prices, discount rates and\nreserves estimates, which are inherently judgemental and complex for management to estimate and challenging to audit.\nAdditionally, the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk remains material to the group.

We obtained evidence supporting that oil and gas price forecasts included in our reasonable\nrange are forecast on a \u2018net producer prices\u2019 basis, (i.e., net of potential future emissions costs that are assumed to be\nborne by oil and gas end users), consistent with the basis of bp\u2019s value-in-use price assumptions.\n\u2022 We assessed management\u2019s disclosures in Note 1, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower\noil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced\ndemand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in bp\u2019s value-in-use estimates for oil\nand gas CGUs.\nDiscount rates\n\u2022 We independently evaluated bp\u2019s discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists,\nagainst relevant third party market and peer data.\n\u2022 When performing procedures over specific assets, we assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments\nwere reasonably reflected in bp\u2019s discount rates.\n\u2022 We challenged and evaluated management\u2019s disclosures in Note 1, including in relation to the sensitivity of discount\nrate assumptions.\nReserves and resources estimates\nWith the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:\n\u2022 assessed bp\u2019s reserves and resources estimation methods and policies for reasonableness;\n\u2022 assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp\u2019s reserves and resources estimates which included\nthose that we judged to represent the greatest risk of material misstatement;\n\u2022 read and evaluated a sample of reports provided by management\u2019s external reserves experts and assessed the scope\nof work and findings of these third parties;\n\u2022 assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of bp\u2019s internal and external reserve experts, through\nunderstanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience;\n\u2022 assessed whether management\u2019s production forecasts are consistent overall with bp\u2019s strategy;\n\u2022 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management\u2019s approved reserves and resources\nestimates; and\n\u2022 performed a retrospective assessment in order to assess management's ability to accurately estimate reserves and\nresources and to check for indications of estimation bias over time.", "page_start": 123, "page_end": 124, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

We determined that bp\u2019s \u2018best estimate\u2019 assumptions are reasonable when compared against a\nrange of third party forecasts and peer information that we identified as being appropriate for this purpose. In forming this\nview, we included each forecaster\u2019s \u2018base case\u2019, \u2018central case\u2019 or \u2018most likely\u2019 estimate.\nWe further observed that, as well as publishing a \u2018base case\u2019, \u2018central case\u2019 or \u2018most likely\u2019 estimate, certain third party price\nforecasters including the IEA published other price forecasts including some that were stated as, or were interpreted by us\nas being, Paris \u2018well below 2\u00b0C goal\u2019 or Paris \u20181.5\u00b0C ambition\u2019 scenarios. We observed that none of those third party\nforecasters described their \u2018Paris consistent\u2019 scenarios as their \u2018base case\u2019, \u2018central case\u2019 or \u2018most likely\u2019 estimate.\nManagement notes on page 145 that they consider their \u2018best estimate\u2019 prices to be in line with a range of transition paths\nconsistent with the Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C as well as the ambition to limit global\nwarming to no greater than 1.5\u00b0C. We observed that for bp\u2019s Brent price assumptions, whilst these were within the lower\nhalf of our range of \u2018best estimate\u2019 forecasts described above, they were within the higher half of our range of Paris \u2018well\nbelow 2\u00b0C goal\u2019 and \u20181.5\u00b0C ambition\u2019 scenarios. For Henry Hub gas, management\u2019s updated gas price assumptions sit\ntowards the top of our range until 2040 and then towards the middle until 2050. The positioning of bp\u2019s revised oil and gas\nforecasts within the range is broadly consistent with bp\u2019s positioning in the prior period range. We also noted other\nreputable third party sources that set out or implied even higher prices under both Paris \u2018well below 2\u00b0C goal\u2019 and \u20181.5\u00b0C\nambition\u2019 scenarios, highlighting the large inherent uncertainty regarding \u2018Paris consistent\u2019 pathways and the very wide\nrange of potential price forecasts. Accordingly, we consider management\u2019s statement as set out above to be reasonable.\nBy inquiry and analysis, we confirmed that the third party oil and gas price forecasts used to develop our independent\nrange are on a net producer price basis. Accordingly, we are satisfied management\u2019s judgement is reasonable that the\npotential impact of further emission costs being borne by bp is not expected to have a material impact on the group\u2019s oil\nand gas CGU carrying values.\nWe reviewed the disclosures included in Note 1 to the accounts in respect of oil and gas price assumptions, including the\nsensitivity analysis presented therein. We observed that management\u2019s downside sensitivity, in which oil and gas prices\nare lower than the \u2018best estimate\u2019 in all future periods, is close to the bottom end of our range of third party Paris \u2018well\nbelow 2\u00b0C goal\u2019 and Paris \u20181.5\u00b0C ambition\u2019 scenarios for both Brent oil and Henry Hub gas.\nDiscount rates\nbp\u2019s post-tax nominal 8% discount rate used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets, was within the independent\nrange calculated by our valuation specialists.\nWe were also satisfied with the calculation of country risk premia.

The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key\nestimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation and discount rate assumptions.\nManagement estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp\u2019s\ndecommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%, which is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%.\nThe extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ from the general inflation rate depends on\nindustry demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the time future decommissioning occurs, which in turn\nwill be influenced by future oil and gas demand, and increasingly by structural changes in the industry supply chain driven\nby the energy transition, which are uncertain.\nThe estimated undiscounted cost of the obligations and the timing of future payments are set out in Note 1 on page 159.\nEconomic factors, future activities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates,\nwhereas the timing of decommissioning activities is dependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are\nsensitive to changes in bp\u2019s price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of oil and gas reserve\nestimates.\nbp increased the discount rate used in calculating its decommissioning provisions from 4.0% as at 31 December 2023 to\n4.5% as at 31 December 2024. The increase was primarily driven by increased US treasury bond rates.\nAdditionally, bp is exposed to decommissioning obligations that could revert back to the group in respect of historical\ndivestments to third parties. Judgement is required to assess the potential risk of reversion and if applicable, the\nestimated exposure, for each historically divested asset. The risk of reversion could be elevated by the potential impact of\nthe energy transition, in particular the potential for lower oil and gas prices in the longer term which could result in financial\nresilience concerns for some industry participants.\nProvisions for decommissioning refining assets, not generally recognised on the basis that the potential obligations\ncannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions in demand due\nto climate change curtail their operational lives. As disclosed in Note 1 on page 159 management concluded that, although\nobligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations, they would only be recognised at the point when\nsufficient information became available to determine potential settlement dates. Accordingly, other than where a decision\nhas been made to cease refining operations, no triggers for assessing the need to record a decommissioning provision\nhave been identified.\nThis matter was discussed by the Audit Committee on page 85.\nHow the scope of our audit Long-term inflation rate\nresponded to the key audit\n\u2022 We tested the relevant control related to the determination of the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption.\nmatter\n\u2022 We tested how management derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption of 1.5%, and the evidence\non which it is based, by gaining an understanding of the process used by management, testing management\u2019s\ncalculations of the assumption, and evaluating the evidence relevant to management\u2019s assumption, both supporting\nand contradictory.\n\u2022 As the 1.5% decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption is determined by making an adjustment to\nmanagement\u2019s 2.0% general long term inflation rate assumption, we evaluated the general long term inflation rate\nassumption used of 2.0%, comparing it against latest external market data.\n\u2022 We made inquiries and evaluated the competence, capability and objectivity of management\u2019s decommissioning\nexperts who derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate.\n\u2022 We inspected analyst forecasts and reports in respect of the future decommissioning market and related costs for\nevidence of supporting and contradictory evidence, with particular focus on the future rig market.\n\u2022 We particularly considered the expectation that demand for oil and gas products and related activities will decrease,\nprimarily in response to climate change and energy transition effects pivoting future energy industry investment and\ndevelopment activity towards renewable sources. We challenged and evaluated management\u2019s assessment of the\nimpact this will have on the decommissioning market and the related inflation assumption.\n\u2022 We analysed historical trends of rig market rates against oil prices and historical inflation to evaluate management\u2019s\nassumption that the decommissioning inflation assumption does not inflate at the same rate as general inflation.", "page_start": 125, "page_end": 126, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

We assessed the relevant internal and external evidence used in forming this judgement, including the financial\nhealth of the counterparty or counterparties in the ownership chain for the divested assets and the existence of any\nother pertinent factors which could indicate a higher probability of decommissioning obligations reverting to bp.\nPotential decommissioning of refinery assets\n\u2022 We challenged and evaluated management\u2019s analysis which supported the judgement that no decommissioning\nprovisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no\ncurrent intention to cease these activities.\n\u2022 We have reviewed analysis undertaken by management, as well as third-party studies, of forecast demand for refined\nproducts in regions served by bp\u2019s refineries. Furthermore, we read external profitability benchmarking to assess the\nconclusion that the group\u2019s remaining refineries would likely remain operational for longer than many of their regional\ncompetitors, in the event of refining capacity reductions.\n\u2022 We also met with refinery management to understand the potential plans under consideration for refineries in the\nfuture and obtained evidence that management is developing plans for the existing refinery sites remaining in the\nportfolio which would be compatible with net zero emissions, for instance through the production of alternative low\ncarbon and sustainable fuels.\nKey observations We concluded that the assumed inflation rate of 1.5% remains reasonable as a long-term inflation rate for\ndecommissioning liabilities. With respect to the extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ\nfrom the general inflation rate, which is influenced by the demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the\ntime future decommissioning occurs, we concluded that market forecasts support the assertion that demand for rigs will\nnot increase in the long term as a result of the impact of the energy transition and therefore that inflation of rig costs will\nbe limited.\nWe concluded that the cost and timing assumptions used in the decommissioning provision calculation were reasonable\nand the assumptions are appropriately supported by industry data. The disclosure included on page 159 with respect to\nthe estimated undiscounted cost of bp\u2019s decommissioning obligations and the timing of future decommissioning\npayments are consistent with these conclusions.\nBased on our audit procedures, we consider bp\u2019s 4.5% discount rate to be reasonable.\nNo material additional decommissioning provisions have been made in respect of historical divestments where bp are\nexposed to decommissioning reversion risk as a result of the potential future bankruptcy of the current asset owner.\nBased on our review and challenge of management\u2019s assessment, we consider this judgement to be reasonable. We also\nconsider the contingent liability disclosure to be reasonable.\nIn respect of the group\u2019s refining assets, taking into consideration both the IEA demand forecasts and management\u2019s\nstrategic plans for the group\u2019s refineries, including developing production of low carbon and sustainable fuels, we are\nsatisfied that it is not currently possible for management to determine closure dates for the remaining operational\nrefineries or estimate reliably a settlement date for any decommissioning obligations prior to a decision being made to\ncease refining operations.

To discharge this responsibility, ST&S regularly executes commodity contracts,\nphysically settled or otherwise, which are accounted for as a derivative and fair valued under IFRS 9. These contracts,\ntherefore, result in unrealised gains/losses that are recognised on account of fair value movements in the associated\nderivative assets and liabilities.\nDetermining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly where the\nvaluation is dependent on significant inputs which are not observable and are classified as level 3 in the fair value\nhierarchy set out in IFRS 13. This degree of subjectivity also makes such fair value estimates liable to potential fraud by\nmanagement incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements, sensitivity\nto management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we have identified a significant risk\nin respect of certain financial instruments where the valuation is dependent on significant unobservable inputs.\nFair value measurements associated with unrealised commodity contracts are also impacted by the macroeconomic\nsentiment and outlook. In 2024, commodity markets continued to experience periods of volatility due to continuing\nuncertainty resulting from the planned energy transition, macro-economic factors such as inflation and interest rates, and\ndisruptions in global supply due to geopolitical conflicts. In response to the volatility observed, we focused our audit\nefforts on the valuation of commodity derivatives and designed procedures to test for management bias.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the group\u2019s total level 3 derivative financial assets were $16.0 billion (2023 $9.2 billion) and level\n3 derivative financial liabilities were $14.4 billion (2023 $7.1 billion).\nThis matter was discussed by the Audit Committee on page 85.\nHow the scope of our audit In response to the above, we analysed the population of these instruments to assess the level of unobservability of the\nresponded to the key audit inputs used in their valuation and then further disaggregated the population into different risk populations which in turn\nmatter drove the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.\nTo address the complexities associated with auditing the valuation of instruments dependent on significant unobservable\ninputs, we included valuation specialists with significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our\naudit procedures. Our valuation audit work included the following control and substantive procedures:\n\u2022 We tested the group\u2019s valuation relevant controls including:\n\u2013 the model certification control, which is designed to review a model\u2019s theoretical soundness and the\nappropriateness of its valuation methodology; and\n\u2013 the independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs\nthat are not observable and are significant to the financial instrument\u2019s valuation.\n\u2022 We performed valuation testing procedures at interim and year-end balance sheet dates, including:\n\u2013 evaluating management\u2019s valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a\nconsistent framework is applied across the business period over period;\n\u2013 engaging our valuation specialists to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and evaluate consistency\nin management\u2019s modelling and input assumptions throughout the year;\n\u2013 comparing management\u2019s input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants\nand observable market data;\n\u2013 independently validating price points on pricing curves; and\n\u2013 analysing whether there was any indication of management bias through evaluating the distribution of valuation\ndifferences where relevant.\nKey observations Based on the evaluation of the results of the procedures noted above, we concluded that management\u2019s valuations\nrelating to commodity derivatives were appropriate and we did not identify evidence of management bias in the valuation\nestimates or accounting entries that we tested.", "page_start": 127, "page_end": 128, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

These included analytical reviews, controls over closing balances, period-end analytical\nreview controls and certain automated business controls.\nThis area had a significant bearing again this year on the allocation of audit resources and has been discussed with the\naudit committee throughout the year.

Our application of materiality\n6.1 Materiality\nWe define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably\nknowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our\nwork.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nGroup financial statements Parent company financial statements\nMateriality In 2024 we set materiality for both the group and parent company at $800 million.\nIn 2023, we used a materiality of $1,000 million for both the group and parent company. The decrease in materiality is due to\nthe downturn in the group\u2019s performance compared with prior year.\nBasis for determining Changing macroeconomic conditions, one-off transactions We determined materiality for our audit of the standalone\nmateriality and strategic decisions had a significant impact on the parent using 0.6% (2023 0.8%) of net assets.\ngroup\u2019s profit before tax in 2024. We therefore determined\nthat it is appropriate to use the benchmarks of most\nrelevance to investors, being cash flow from operations and\nunderlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.\nMateriality was determined to be $800 million, which is 2.9%\nof cash flow from operations (2023 3.1%) and 3.9% of\nunderlying replacement cost profit before tax (2023 3.7%). In\n2023, we determined materiality to be $1,000 million, which\nrepresented 4.2% of profit before tax and 3.7% of underlying\nreplacement cost profit before tax.\nRationale for the We conducted an assessment of which line items are the The materiality determined for the standalone parent\nbenchmark applied most important to investors and analysts by reading analyst company is based on net assets as the company is non-\nreports and bp's communications to shareholders and trading and operates primarily as a holding company. We\nlenders, as well as the communications of peer companies. believe the net asset position is the most appropriate\nbenchmark to use.\nBased on our review of analysts\u2019 reports, all analysts\nidentified one or more cashflow metrics as a key operating\nmetric, particularly net cash flow from operations. Also,\nbased on our assessment of the latest results announcement\nQ&As, the focus of the investors has been on cash flow\ngeneration and the strength of the balance sheet, particularly\nfrom a net debt perspective given the current underlying\nperformance of the group. We therefore focused on cash\nflow from operations in our determination of materiality for\nthe current year.\nWe further note that the alternative performance measure\nunderlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax is\none of the key metrics communicated by management in\nbp's results announcements and therefore is considered to\nbe an appropriate benchmark.\nFinancial statements\nGroup materiality $800m\nComponent materiality range\n$182m to $416m\nAudit committee\nCash flow from reporting\noperations $27,297m threshold $40m\nGroup materiality $800m\nComponent materiality range\n$182m to $416m\nAudit\ncommittee\nUnderlying RCP reporting\nbefore interest threshold $40m\nand tax\n$20,624m\n6.2 Performance materiality\nWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements\nexceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\nGroup financial statements Parent company financial statements\nPerformance materiality Group and parent company performance materiality was set at 65% of materiality for the 2024 audit (2023 65% of\nmateriality).\nBasis and rationale for Consistent with the prior year, performance materiality of 65% reflects the overall quality of the control environment, the\ndetermining performance magnitude of misstatements identified in the current and prior years, as well as the fact that management is generally willing\nmateriality to correct any such misstatements.\n6.3 Error reporting threshold\nWe agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of $40 million (2023 $50 million), as well as\ndifferences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters\nthat we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n7. An overview of the scope of our audit\n7.1 Identification and scoping of components\nAs a result of the highly disaggregated nature of the group, with operations in over 60 countries through approximately 940 cons units, a significant portion\nof our audit planning effort was so that the scope of our work was appropriate in addressing the identified risks of material misstatement.\nThe factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the bp audit, and the level of work to be performed included the following:\n\u2022 The determination of significance of an account balance and risks of material misstatement related to it, history of unusual or complex transactions,\nidentification of significant audit issues or the potential for, or a history of, material misstatements.\n\u2022 The effectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including entity-level controls.\n\u2022 The findings, observations and audit differences that we noted as a result of our 2023 audit engagement.\nOur audit approach was generally to place reliance on management\u2019s controls over financial reporting.", "page_start": 129, "page_end": 131, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Our full-scope audits\nwere in the UK, US, Australia, Azerbaijan and Germany. In addition, component teams performed audit procedures on specified account balances in 24\ncons units also covering Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal, Indonesia, Egypt, India and Abu Dhabi.\nThe group engagement team performed audit procedures on specified account balances to component materiality, with certain additional specific\nprocedures performed by component teams, covering an additional 25 cons units (2023 27).\nThe remaining cons units are not significant individually and include many small, low risk components and balances. On average, they each represent\n0.04% of revenue (2023 0.04%), 0.04% of property, plant and equipment (2023 0.03%) and 0.04% of profit before tax (2023 0.04%).\nIn our assessment of the residual balances not covered by the above procedures, we have considered the risk that there could be undetected and\nuncorrected misstatements that are material in the aggregate within the large number of geographically dispersed businesses, in particular within the C&P\nsegment. This assessment included use of our analytic tools to interrogate data, preparation of trend analysis and comparison of business performance to\nmarket benchmark prices. We also tested management's group-wide controls across a range of locations and segments. We concluded that through this\nadditional risk assessment, we have reduced the audit risk of such misstatements arising to a sufficiently low level.\nOur audit coverage of \u2018Property, plant and equipment\u2019, \u2018Revenue\u2019 and \u2018Profit before tax\u2019 is materially the same as in the prior year.\nRevenue Profit before tax Property, plant & equipment\n31% 28% 27%\n2% 3% 6%\n67% 69% 67%\nAudit of specific account balances Audit of specific account balances Audit of specific account balances\nSpecified audit procedures Specified audit procedures Specified audit procedures\nReview at group level Review at group level Review at group level\n7.2 Our consideration of the control environment\nOur audit approach was generally to place reliance on management\u2019s relevant controls over all business cycles affecting in scope financial statement line\nitems. We tested a sample of these controls through a combination of tests of inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance.\nIn limited situations where we were not able to take a controls reliance approach due to controls being deficient and there not being sufficient mitigating or\nalternative controls we could rely on instead, we adopted a non-controls reliance approach. All control deficiencies which we considered to be significant\nwere communicated to the audit committee. All other deficiencies were communicated to management. For all deficiencies identified we considered the\nimpact and updated our audit plan accordingly.\nThe group\u2019s financial systems environment is complex, with 101 separate IT systems scoped as being relevant to the audit for the following key locations\n(UK, US, Germany, Azerbaijan and Australia) as well as other minor locations. These systems are all directly or indirectly relevant to the entity\u2019s financial\nreporting process.\nWe planned to rely on the General IT Controls (\u2018GITCs\u2019) associated with these systems, and having tested controls over access security, change\nmanagement, data centre operations and network operations, were able to do so.\n7.3 Working with other auditors\nThe group audit team is responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and providing direct oversight, review, and coordination of our\ncomponent audit teams. We interacted regularly with the component Deloitte teams during each stage of the audit and reviewed key working papers. We\nmaintained continuous and open dialogue with our component teams in addition to holding formal meetings quarterly to ensure that we were fully aware\nof their progress and results of their procedures.\nConsistent with prior year, the senior statutory auditor and other group audit partners and staff conducted visits to meet with the component teams\nresponsible for the audits of specified account balances during the year. These visits included attending planning meetings, discussing the audit approach\nincluding the risk assessments and any issues arising from the component team's work, meetings with local management, and reviewing key audit\nworking papers on higher and significant-risk areas to drive a consistent and high-quality audit.

Other information\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly\nstated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially\ninconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be\nmaterially misstated.\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this\ngives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we\nconclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n9. Responsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors\u2019 responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for\nbeing satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial\nstatements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group\u2019s and the parent company\u2019s ability to continue as a going\nconcern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to\nliquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n10. Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an\naudit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and\nare considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the\nbasis of these financial statements.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC\u2019s website at: frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\nThis description forms part of our auditor\u2019s report.\n11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined\nabove, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting\nirregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we\nconsidered the following:\n\u2022 our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Ethics and Compliance and reviews of bp\u2019s internal ethics and compliance reporting\nsummaries, including those concerning investigations;\n\u2022 enquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the group\u2019s\npolicies and procedures relating to:\n\u2013 identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n\u2013 detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and\n\u2013 the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u2022 review of the terms of reference of the Fraud Governance Board set up by management to support the creation and delivery of the Group Fraud Risk\nStrategy, periodically monitor the threat outlook and review the risk appetite;\n\u2022 review of the Fraud Governance Board\u2019s meeting minutes and its fraud risk assessment;\n\u2022 the group\u2019s remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels; and\n\u2022 discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.\nThe engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as bp operates,\nand this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved fraud specialists who advised the\nengagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries, and they participated in the initial fraud risk assessment\ndiscussions.", "page_start": 132, "page_end": 133, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

The key laws and regulations we\nconsidered in this context included the UK Companies Act, UK Corporate Governance Code, US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and relevant SEC\nregulations, as well as laws and regulations prevailing in each country in which we identified a full-scope component.\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which\nmay be fundamental to the group\u2019s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group\u2019s operating licences and environmental\nregulations.\n11.2 Audit response to risks identified\nAs a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We\ndid identify two key audit matters relating to fraud risks, as described above, being the valuation of commodity financial derivatives, and management\noverride of controls. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we\nperformed in response to those key audit matters.\nIn addition to the above, procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\u2022 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and\nregulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n\u2022 enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;\n\u2022 obtaining confirmations from external legal counsel concerning open litigation and claims;\n\u2022 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; and\n\u2022 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC and the IRS.\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists\nand component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\n12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion the part of the directors\u2019 remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u2022 The information given in the strategic report and the directors\u2019 report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is\nconsistent with the financial statements.\n\u2022 The strategic report and the directors\u2019 report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have\nnot identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors\u2019 report.\n13. Corporate Governance Statement\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance\nStatement relating to the group\u2019s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is\nmaterially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\u2022 the directors\u2019 statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties\nidentified set out on page 113\n\u2022 the directors\u2019 explanation as to its assessment of the group\u2019s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out\non page 113\n\u2022 the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 113\n\u2022 the board\u2019s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 112\n\u2022 the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on pages 82-85.", "page_start": 133, "page_end": 134, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as at 31 December\n2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2024, in accordance with\nUnited Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU).\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), bp's internal control\nover financial reporting as of 31 December 2024, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Council\u2019s Guidance on Risk Management,\nInternal Control and Related Financial and Business reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting and our report dated 6 March 2025\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on bp's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of bp\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on bp\u2019s financial statements based on\nour audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to bp in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical\naudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n1. Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets \u2013 Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe group balance sheet as at 31 December 2024 includes PP&E, of which $56 billion is oil and gas properties.\nManagement\u2019s best estimate oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised in 2024 as set out in Note 1 on page 152,\nalthough the revisions were not significant.\nManagement have also determined bp\u2019s \u2018best estimate\u2019 discount rate assumptions, as set out in Note 1 on page 152. Bp\u2019s post-tax discount rate used for\nimpairment testing for oil and gas assets in 2024 remained unchanged from prior year at 8%. Pre-tax discount rates applied in impairment tests were\nrevised in some regions to reflect changes in local tax rates and country risk premiums. Reserves estimates for all oil and gas fields were also reviewed\nand updated where necessary at year-end.\nManagement judged that in aggregate, the year-end oil and gas price assumption revisions, changes to pre-tax discount rates for certain regions due to\ncountry risk premium or tax rate changes and changes to other input assumptions including reserves reductions on several key fields, all combined to\nconstitute an impairment trigger for all oil and gas cash generating units (CGUs). As a result of testing performed during 2024, $2.0 billion of oil and gas\nCGU net impairment charges were recognised, principally due to certain discount rate revisions, an increase in certain capital expenditure forecasts and\noperating expenditure forecasts and certain reserves write downs.\nWe identified three key management estimates in management\u2019s determination of the level of impairment charge and/or impairment reversal. These are:\nOil and gas prices \u2013 bp\u2019s oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment assessments performed across the\nOP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change,\nthe global energy transition, macro-economic factors and disruption in global supply due to ongoing geo-political conflicts. There is a risk that\nmanagement do not forecast reasonable \u2018best estimate\u2019 oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for impairment charge and/or impairment\nreversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions are highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to bp\u2019s oil and gas CGU\nvaluation. There is also a risk that management\u2019s oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.\nDiscount rates \u2013 Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Discount\nrates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management\ndoes not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements.\nDetermining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also a\npervasive input across bp\u2019s oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates.\nReserves and resources estimates \u2013 A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas production forecast, which is based on\nunderlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource\nvolumes, in addition to proven and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these\nvolumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable production forecasts for\nindividually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp\u2019s reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and\nG&LCE segments.", "page_start": 134, "page_end": 136, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

This population includes previously impaired assets which are also at risk of material impairment reversal\nresulting from potential oil and gas price assumption changes. We identified that a subset of these CGUs was also individually materially sensitive to the\ndiscount rate assumption.\nWe also identified CGUs which were less sensitive as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a reasonably possible\nchange in some or all of the key assumptions.\nImpairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a critical audit matter because recoverable\nvalues are reliant on forecast assumptions such as oil and gas prices, discount rates and reserves estimates, which are inherently judgemental, complex\nfor management to estimate and challenging to audit. Additionally, the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk remains material to the group.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\nWe tested relevant internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates, and reserve and resources estimates, as well as relevant\ninternal controls over the performance of the impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we\nconducted the following substantive procedures.\nOil and gas prices\n\u2022 We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management\u2019s oil and gas\nprice assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.\n\u2022 In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.\n\u2022 In challenging and evaluating management\u2019s price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios\nobtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition.\n\u2022 The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of \u2018holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above\npre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u2019 was reaffirmed at CoP 29 in Baku during\nNovember 2024. We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris \u2018well\nbelow 2\u00b0C goal\u2019 and/or \u20181.5\u00b0C ambition\u2019 and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.\n\u2022 We assessed management\u2019s disclosures in Note 1, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how\nclimate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than\ncurrently anticipated in bp\u2019s value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.\nDiscount rates\n\u2022 We independently evaluated bp\u2019s discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists, against relevant third party market\nand peer data.\n\u2022 When performing procedures over specific assets, we assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp\u2019s\ndiscount rates.\n\u2022 We challenged and evaluated management\u2019s disclosures in Note 1, including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.\nReserves and resources estimates\nWith the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:\n\u2022 assessed bp\u2019s reserves and resources estimation methods and policies for reasonableness;\n\u2022 assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp\u2019s reserves and resources estimates;\n\u2022 read and evaluated a sample of reports provided by management\u2019s external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these\nthird parties;\n\u2022 assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of bp\u2019s internal and external reserve experts, through understanding their relevant professional\nqualifications and experience;\n\u2022 assessed whether management\u2019s production forecasts are consistent overall with bp\u2019s strategy;\n\u2022 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management\u2019s approved reserves and resources estimates; and\n\u2022 performed a retrospective assessment in order to assess management's ability to accurately estimate reserves and resources and to check for\nindications of estimation bias over time.\n2. Decommissioning provisions \u2013 Notes 1 and 23 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nA decommissioning provision of $11.8 billion is recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2024. The estimation of decommissioning\nprovisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation\nand discount rate assumptions.\nManagement estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp\u2019s decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%,\nwhich is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%.\nThe estimated undiscounted cost of the obligations and the timing of future payments are set out in Note 1 on page 159. Economic factors, future\nactivities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates, whereas the timing of decommissioning activities is\ndependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are sensitive to changes in bp\u2019s price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of\noil and gas reserve estimates.\nbp increased the discount rate used in calculating its decommissioning provisions from 4.0% as at 31 December 2023 to 4.5% as at 31 December 2024.\nThe increase was primarily driven by increased US treasury bond rates.", "page_start": 136, "page_end": 137, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

We challenged\nand evaluated management\u2019s assessment of the impact this will have on the decommissioning market and related inflation assumption.\n\u2022 We analysed historical trends of rig market rates against oil prices and historical inflation to evaluate management\u2019s assumption that the\ndecommissioning inflation assumption does not inflate at the same rate as general inflation.\nCost and timing estimates\n\u2022 We tested the relevant controls over the year end decommissioning cost and timing assumptions used within management\u2019s decommissioning\nprovision estimate.\n\u2022 We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the assets subject to decommissioning, including understanding the process to establish whether a\nlegal or constructive obligation existed.\n\u2022 We evaluated the reasonableness of changes in key cost assumptions, including rig rates, vessel rates, well plug and abandonment duration, and non-\nproductive time assumptions, with reference to internal and appropriate third-party data.\n\u2022 We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates used for decommissioning\nestimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.\n\u2022 We assessed the accuracy of bp\u2019s disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future decommissioning\npayments.\nDiscount rates\n\u2022 We tested the relevant controls related to the determination of the discount rate assumption.\n\u2022 We assessed the reasonableness of management\u2019s methodology for determining the discount rate and recalculated the discount rate with reference to\nindependent third party data, most notably US treasury bond yields.\nFinancial statements\n3. Valuation of commodity financial derivatives - Notes 1, 29 and 30 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nbp\u2019s supply, trading and shipping (ST&S) function is responsible for globally trading and risk managing the group\u2019s owned as well as third party production.\nTo discharge this responsibility, ST&S regularly executes commodity contracts, physically settled or otherwise, which are accounted for as a derivative and\nfair valued under IFRS 9. These contracts, therefore, result in unrealised gains/losses that are recognised on account of fair value movements in the\nassociated derivative assets and liabilities.\nDetermining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly where the valuation is dependent on significant\ninputs which are not observable and are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS 13. This degree of subjectivity also makes such fair\nvalue estimates liable to potential fraud by management incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements,\nsensitivity to management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we have identified a risk in respect of certain financial\ninstruments where the valuation is dependent on significant unobservable inputs.\nFair value measurements associated with unrealised commodity contracts are also impacted by the macroeconomic sentiment and outlook. In 2024,\ncommodity markets continued to experience periods of volatility due to continuing uncertainty resulting from the planned energy transition, macro-\neconomic factors such as inflation and interest rates, and disruptions in global supply due to geopolitical conflicts. In response to the volatility observed,\nwe focused our audit efforts on the valuation of commodity derivatives and designed procedures to test for management bias.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the group\u2019s total level 3 derivative financial assets were $16.0 billion and level 3 derivative financial liabilities were $14.4 billion.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\nTo address the complexities associated with auditing the valuation of instruments dependent on significant unobservable inputs, we included valuation\nspecialists with significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our audit procedures. Our valuation audit work included the\nfollowing control and substantive procedures:\n\u2022 We tested the group\u2019s valuation relevant controls including:\n\u2013 the model certification control, which is designed to review a model\u2019s theoretical soundness and the appropriateness of its valuation methodology;\nand\n\u2013 the independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs that are not observable and are\nsignificant to the financial instrument\u2019s valuation.\n\u2022 We performed valuation testing procedures including:\n\u2013 evaluating management\u2019s valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a consistent framework is applied\nacross the business period over period;\n\u2013 engaging our valuation specialists to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and evaluate consistency in management\u2019s modelling and input\nassumptions throughout the year;\n\u2013 comparing management\u2019s input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants and observable market data;\n\u2013 independently validating price points on pricing curves to consensus data; and\n\u2013 analysing whether there was any indication of management bias through evaluating the distribution of valuation differences where relevant.", "page_start": 137, "page_end": 139, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Impairment of E&A assets and refinery PP&E as a consequence, among other things, of climate change and the energy transition \u2013\nNotes 1, 4, 8 and 15 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nIntangible Assets\nThe recoverability of certain of the group\u2019s $4.4 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024 is potentially\nexposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors (see Note 15). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed\nas a consequence of the energy transition, or lower forecast future oil and gas prices. The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be written\noff, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex and continues to require significant management judgement.\nPP&E\nThe carrying value of bp\u2019s refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and demand which arise among other\nthings as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Management identified impairment indicators in respect of the Gelsenkirchen\nrefinery in Germany during the year and, as a result, an impairment test was performed to assess the recoverability of the Gelsenkirchen refinery carrying\nvalue. As disclosed in Note 4 to the accounts on page 166, management has recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 billion in respect of the Gelsenkirchen\nrefinery, primarily driven by changes in economic assumptions. At 31 December 2024 management identified an impairment indicator for all of its other\nrefineries due to a reduction in the local marker margins. The impairment tests performed by management to assess the recoverability of the carrying\nvalue of these refineries did not result in any additional impairment charges being recognised.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nIntangible Assets\nIn respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024:\n\u2022 We tested the relevant controls within the group\u2019s E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes; and\n\u2022 We challenged and evaluated management\u2019s key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6. Where impairment indicators were\nidentified we corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing\nevidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management\u2019s key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting\nminutes and assessing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or\nmodify key terms.\nPP&E\nWe considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group\u2019s refining portfolio and assessed internal and external market studies\nof future supply and demand. In relation to refinery impairment tests performed by management, our audit procedures included:\n\u2022 Evaluating the valuation methodology and testing the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment models;\n\u2022 Assessing the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs to the impairment models, notably forecast refining margins, discount rate and energy\ninput costs, challenging and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions by reference to third party data where available and involvement of our valuation\nspecialists; and\n\u2022 Evaluating management\u2019s ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results with historical forecasts and tested\nmanagement\u2019s internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\nLondon\nUnited Kingdom\n6 March 2025\nWe have served as bp\u2019s auditor since 2018.\n1.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\nLondon, United Kingdom\n6 March 2025", "page_start": 140, "page_end": 141, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions\nAuthorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\nThe consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as bp or the group) were approved and signed by the chief\nexecutive officer and chairman on 6 March 2025 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. BP p.l.c. is a public limited company\nincorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted\ninternational accounting standards and IFRS Accounting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as\nadopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under\ninternational accounting standards. IFRS as adopted by the UK does not differ from IFRS as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the UK and EU differs\nin certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the group\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the years\npresented. The material accounting policy information and accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions of the group are set out below.\nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRSs and IFRS Interpretations Committee\n(IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2024. The accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all\nyears presented, except where otherwise indicated.\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where\notherwise indicated.\nMaterial accounting policy information: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements is the need for bp management to\nmake judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities,\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting\njudgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with\nthe information provided in the Notes on financial statements.\nThe areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for the\ninvestments in Rosneft and Aker BP; exploration and appraisal intangible assets; the recoverability of asset carrying values, including the estimation of\nreserves; supplier financing arrangements; derivative financial instruments; provisions and contingencies; pensions and other post-employment benefits;\nand taxation. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and geopolitical\nenvironment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the consolidated financial statements are also set out in boxed text\nbelow. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next\nfinancial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.\nJudgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These may have\nsignificant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the group\u2019s assets and liabilities discussed below and on similar assets and liabilities that may\nbe recognized in the future. The group\u2019s assumptions for investment appraisal (see page 20) form part of an investment decision-making framework for\ncurrently unsanctioned future capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment, and intangibles including exploration and appraisal assets, that is\ndesigned to support the effective and resilient implementation of bp\u2019s strategy. The price assumptions used for investment appraisal include oil and gas\nprice assumptions, which are producer prices and are therefore net of any future carbon prices that the purchaser may be required to pay, and an\nassumption of a single carbon emissions cost imposed on the producer in respect of operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and\nmethane) in order to incentivize engineering solutions to mitigate GHG emissions on projects. The group's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use\nimpairment testing are aligned with those investment appraisal assumptions. The assumptions for future carbon emissions costs in value-in-use\nimpairment testing differ from the investment appraisal assumptions and are described below.\nManagement has also not identified any off-balance sheet commodity purchase obligations to be onerous contracts as result of the transition to a lower\ncarbon economy at 31 December 2024.\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill\nThe energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of\nproperty, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management\u2019s best estimate of oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-\nuse impairment testing were revised during 2024. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real 2023 terms and are materially consistent with\nthe disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints\nbefore declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will\ncause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that\ndeclining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. The revised assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas sit within the range of\nexternal scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate\nchange agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit\nthe temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.", "page_start": 146, "page_end": 147, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nAs noted above, the group\u2019s investment appraisal process includes a carbon emissions price series for the investment economics which is applied to\nbp's anticipated share of bp's forecast of the investment assets' scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions where they exceed defined thresholds, and is assumed to\napply whether or not bp is the asset operator. However, for value-in-use impairment testing on bp's existing cash generating units (CGUs), consistent with\nall other relevant cash flows estimated, bp is required to reflect management's best estimate of any expected applicable carbon emission costs payable\nby bp, including where bp is not the operator, in the future for each jurisdiction in which the group has interests. This requires management\u2019s best\nestimate of how future changes to relevant carbon emission cost policies and/or legislation are likely to affect the future cash flows of the group\u2019s\napplicable CGUs, whether currently enacted or not. Future potential carbon pricing and/or costs of carbon emissions allowances are included in the\nvalue-in-use calculations to the extent management has sufficient information to make such an estimate. Currently this results in limited application of\ncarbon price assumptions in value-in-use impairment tests given that carbon pricing legislation in most impacted jurisdictions where the group has\ninterests is not in place and there is not sufficient information available as to the relevant policy makers' future intentions regarding carbon pricing to\nsupport an estimate. A key input into the determination of impairment is the assumption, aligned with bp\u2019s aim to reach net zero greenhouse gas\nemissions by 2050 or sooner, that the current recognized portfolio of oil and gas properties and refining assets will have an immaterial carrying value by\n2050.\nWhere we consider that the outcome of a value-in-use impairment test could be significantly affected by a carbon price in place in any jurisdiction, this is\nincorporated into the value-in use impairment testing cash flows. The most significant instances where a carbon price has been incorporated in the 2024\nvalue-in-use impairment tests is for the UK North Sea and the Gelsenkirchen refinery. The assumptions for UK North Sea were \u00a359/tCOe in 2025\n2\ngradually increasing to \u00a3231/tCOe in 2050. The assumption applied for the Gelsenkirchen refinery was an average of approximately $97/tCOe.\n2 2\nHowever, as bp\u2019s forecast future prices are producer prices, the group considers it reasonable to assume that if, in addition to the costs already in place,\nfurther scope 1 and 2 emission costs were partially to be borne directly by oil and gas producers including bp in future and the prevalence of such costs\nwere to become widespread, the gross oil and gas prices realized by producers would be correspondingly higher over the long term, resulting in no\nexpected overall materially negative impacts on the group\u2019s net cash flows. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying\nvalues for further information including sensitivity analysis in relation to reasonably possible changes in the price assumptions and carbon costs.\nProduction assumptions within upstream property, plant and equipment and goodwill value-in-use impairment tests reflect management\u2019s current best\nestimate of future production of the existing upstream portfolio. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and\nNote 14 for sensitivity analyses in relation to reasonably possible changes in production for upstream oil and gas properties and goodwill respectively.\nFor the customers & products segment, though the energy transition may impact demand for certain refined products in the future, management\nanticipates sufficiently robust demand for the remainder of each refinery\u2019s useful life.\nManagement will continue to review price assumptions as the energy transition progresses and this may result in impairment charges or reversals in the\nfuture.\nExploration and appraisal intangible assets\nThe energy transition may affect the future development or viability of exploration prospects. The recoverability of the group's exploration and appraisal\nintangible assets was considered during 2024. No significant write-offs were identified. These assets will continue to be assessed as the energy\ntransition progresses. See significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets and Note 8 for further information.\nProperty, plant and equipment \u2013 depreciation and expected useful lives\nThe energy transition may curtail the expected useful lives of oil and gas industry assets thereby accelerating depreciation charges. However, a\nsignificant majority of bp\u2019s existing upstream oil and natural gas properties are likely to have immaterial carrying values within the next 12 years and, as\noutlined in bp's strategy, oil and natural gas production will remain an important part of bp\u2019s business activities over that period. The significant majority\nof refining assets, recognized on the group\u2019s balance sheet at 31 December 2024 that are subject to depreciation, will be depreciated within the next 12\nyears; demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient to support the remaining useful lives of existing assets. Therefore, management does\nnot expect the useful lives of bp\u2019s reported property, plant and equipment to change and do not consider this to be a significant accounting judgement or\nestimate. Significant capital expenditure is still required for ongoing projects as well as renewal and/or replacement of aged assets and therefore the\nuseful lives of future capital expenditure may be different.

See material accounting policy: property, plant and equipment for more information.\nFinancial statements\n1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nProvisions: decommissioning\nThe energy transition may bring forward the decommissioning of oil and gas industry assets thereby increasing the present value of associated\ndecommissioning provisions. The majority of bp\u2019s existing upstream oil and gas properties are expected to start decommissioning within the next two\ndecades. Currently, the expected timing of decommissioning expenditures for the upstream oil and gas assets in the group\u2019s portfolio has not materially\nbeen brought forward. Management does not expect a reasonably possible change of two years in the expected timing of all decommissioning to have a\nmaterial effect on the upstream decommissioning provisions, assuming cost assumptions remain unchanged.\nDecommissioning cost estimates are based on the known regulatory and external environment. These cost estimates may change in the future, including\nas a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy. For refineries, decommissioning provisions are generally not recognized as the associated\nobligations have indeterminate settlement dates, typically driven by the cessation of manufacturing. Management does not expect manufacturing to\ncease at refineries within a determinate period of time, as existing property, plant and equipment is expected to be renewed or replaced. Management will\ncontinue to review facts and circumstances, including where cessation of manufacturing decisions have been made, to assess if decommissioning\nprovisions need to be recognized. Decommissioning provisions relating to refineries at 31 December 2024 are not material. See significant judgements\nand estimates: provisions for further information.\nJudgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards\nto the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment.\nOil and gas price assumptions\nOil and gas price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing have been updated for inflation and have been rebased in real 2023 terms. See\nsignificant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information.\nDiscount rate assumptions\nThe discount rates used for impairment testing and provisions were reassessed during the year in light of changing economic and geopolitical outlooks.\nThe nominal discount rate applied to provisions was increased during the year to reflect higher US Treasury yields. The principal impact of this rate\nincrease was a $0.9 billion decrease in the decommissioning provision with an associated decrease in the carrying amount of property, plant and\nequipment of $0.7 billion and a pre-tax credit to the income statement of $0.2 billion. The post-tax impairment discount rate applicable to assets other\nthan renewable power assets remained consistent with 2023 as did the risk premium applied to the majority of countries classified as higher-risk. See\nsignificant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions for further information.\nPensions and other post-employment benefits\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2024 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of\ndefined benefit obligations in the group\u2019s defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits and Note\n24 for further information.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are\nconsolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, including when control is obtained via potential voting\nrights, and continue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases.\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. Intra-group\nbalances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated unless\nthe transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within non-\ncontrolling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by subsidiaries and for which the group has the unconditional right to avoid\ntransferring cash or another financial asset to the holders. Profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders is adjusted to reflect the coupon/interest related to\nthese hybrid securities whether or not such distribution has been deferred.\nInterests in other entities\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair\nvalues at the acquisition date.\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest and\nthe acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nat the acquisition date. The amount recognized for any non-controlling interest is measured at the present ownership's proportionate share in the\nrecognized amounts of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating\nunits, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from the combination\u2019s synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost\nless any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 January 2003 is stated at the previous carrying amount\nunder UK generally accepted accounting practice, less subsequent impairments.\nGoodwill may arise upon investments in joint ventures and associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the group\u2019s share of the net fair\nvalue of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Any such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment in joint ventures and associates.\nGoodwill may also arise upon acquisition of interests in joint operations that meet the definition of a business. The amount of goodwill separately\nrecognized is the excess of the consideration transferred over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.", "page_start": 148, "page_end": 149, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nInterests in joint arrangements\nThe results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as\ndescribed below.\nCertain of the group\u2019s activities, particularly in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, are conducted through joint\noperations. bp recognizes, on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint\noperations incurred jointly with the other partners, along with the group\u2019s revenue from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses\nthat the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation.\nFor joint arrangements in a separate entity, judgement may be required as to whether the arrangement should be classified as a joint venture or if the legal\nform, contractual arrangements or other facts and circumstances indicate that the group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the\narrangement, rather than rights to the net assets, and therefore should be classified as a joint operation. No such judgement made by the group is\nconsidered significant.\nInterests in associates\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as\ndescribed below.\nSignificant judgement: investment in Aker BP\nJudgement is required in assessing the level of control or influence over another entity in which the group holds an interest. For bp, the judgement that\nthe group has significant influence over Aker BP, a Norwegian oil and gas company, is significant.\nAs a consequence of this judgement, bp uses the equity method of accounting for its investment and bp's share of Aker BP's oil and natural gas reserves\nis included in the group's estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities. If significant influence was not present, the investment would be\naccounted for as an investment in an equity instrument measured at fair value as described under 'Financial assets' below and no share of Aker BP's oil\nand natural gas reserves would be reported.\nSignificant influence is defined in IFRS as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint\ncontrol of those decisions. Significant influence is presumed when an entity owns 20% or more of the voting power of the investee. Significant influence\nis presumed not to be present when an entity owns less than 20% of the voting power of the investee.\nbp owned 15.9% of the voting shares at 31 December 2024. bp\u2019s senior vice president North Sea, Doris Reiter, was appointed a member of the Aker BP\nboard during 2024. bp\u2019s other nominated director, group chief financial officer, Kate Thomson, has been a member of the Aker BP board since formation\nof that company in 2016. She is also a member of the Aker BP board\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee. bp also holds the voting rights at general meetings of\nshareholders conferred by its stake in Aker BP. bp's management considers, therefore, that the group continues to have significant influence at 31\nDecember 2024.\nSignificant judgements and estimate: investment in Rosneft\nSince the first quarter 2022, bp accounts for its interest in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, as financial assets measured at\nfair value within \u2018Other investments\u2019. bp is not able to sell its Rosneft shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange and is unable to ascribe probabilities to\npossible outcomes of any exit process. It is considered by management that any measure of fair value, other than nil, would be subject to such high\nmeasurement uncertainty, considering the sanctions and restrictions implemented by Russia on Russian assets held by foreign investors, that no\nestimate would provide useful information even if it were accompanied by a description of the estimate made in producing it and an explanation of the\nuncertainties that affect the estimate. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to estimate any carrying value other than zero when determining the\nmeasurement of the interest in Rosneft and the other businesses with Rosneft within Russia as at 31 December 2024. Events or outcomes within the\nnext financial year, that are different to those outlined above, could materially change the fair value of the investment.\nRussia has imposed restrictions on the payments of dividends to certain foreign shareholders, including those based in the UK, requiring such dividends\nto be paid in roubles into restricted bank accounts and a requirement for approval of the Russian government for transfers from any such bank accounts\nout of Russia. Given the restrictions applicable to such accounts, management has made the significant judgement that the criteria for recognizing any\ndividend income from Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, for the years to 31 December 2022, 31 December 2023 and 31\nDecember 2024 have not been met.\nThe equity method of accounting\nUnder the equity method, an investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group\u2019s share of net assets of the\nentity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Loans advanced to equity-accounted entities that have the\ncharacteristics of equity financing are also included in the investment on the group balance sheet. The group income statement reflects the group\u2019s share\nof the results after tax of the equity-accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment of the equity-accounted\nentity\u2019s assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The group statement of comprehensive income includes the group\u2019s share of the equity-\naccounted entity\u2019s other comprehensive income. The group\u2019s share of amounts recognized directly in equity by an equity-accounted entity is recognized in\nthe group\u2019s statement of changes in equity.\nFinancial statements of equity-accounted entities are typically prepared for the same reporting year as the group. Where material differences arise in the\naccounting policies used by the equity-accounted entity and those used by bp, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the accounting\npolicies used into line with those of the group. Unrealized gains on transactions, apart from those that meet the definition of a derivative, between the\ngroup and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the group\u2019s interest in the equity-accounted entity.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nSegmental reporting\nThe group\u2019s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the group that are evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer,\nbp\u2019s chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group\u2019s accounting policies described in this note, except that IFRS requires that\nthe measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker. For bp,\nthis measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is\narrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized\nmeasure under IFRS.\nFor further information see Note 5.\nForeign currency translation\nIn individual subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities\nat the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the\nfunctional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement, unless\nhedge accounting is applied. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and related\ngoodwill, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional\ncurrency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange. In the consolidated financial\nstatements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency\nsubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other\ncomprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term intra-group foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group\u2019s non-US dollar\ninvestments are also reported in other comprehensive income if the borrowings form part of the net investment in the subsidiary, joint venture or\nassociate. On disposal or for certain partial disposals of a non-US dollar functional currency subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the related accumulated\nexchange gains and losses recognized in equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement.\nNon-current assets held for sale\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\nSignificant non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction\nrather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for\nimmediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to\nthe sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and\nactions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be\nwithdrawn.\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized, and equity accounting of associates and joint ventures is ceased\nonce classified as held for sale.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, biogas rights agreements,\ndigital assets, patents, licences and trademarks and are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated\nimpairment losses.\nIntangible assets are carried initially at cost unless acquired as part of a business combination. Any such asset is measured at fair value at the date of the\nbusiness combination and is recognized separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.\nIntangible assets with a finite life, other than capitalized exploration and appraisal costs as described below, are amortized on a straight-line basis over\ntheir expected useful lives. For patents, licences and trademarks, expected useful life is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic\nuseful life, and can range from three to fifteen years. The expected useful life of biogas rights agreements is the shorter of the duration of the legal\nagreement and economic useful life and can be up to 50 years. Digital asset costs generally have a useful life of three to five years.\nThe expected useful lives of assets and the amortization method are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the\namortization method are accounted for prospectively.\nOil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure\nOil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure is accounted for using the principles of the successful efforts method of accounting as described\nbelow.\nLicence and property acquisition costs\nExploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm\nthat there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under\nway or planned or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical\nand commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned, the\nremaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off. Lower value licences are pooled and amortized on a straight-line basis over\nthe estimated period of exploration. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves of oil and natural\ngas, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.\nExploration and appraisal expenditure\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially\ncapitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration,\nmaterials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors. If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration\nwell costs are written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs\ncontinue to be carried as an asset.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nCosts directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the\ninitial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset.\nUpon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property,\nplant and equipment. If development is not approved and no further activity is expected to occur, then the costs are expensed.\nThe determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is usually made within one\nyear of well completion, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic\nquantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure (e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before\nproduction could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration or\nappraisal work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as such work is under way or firmly planned.\nSignificant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets\nJudgement is required to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to carry costs associated with exploration wells and exploratory-type\nstratigraphic test wells on the balance sheet. This includes costs relating to exploration licences or leasehold property acquisitions. It is not unusual to\nhave such costs remaining suspended on the balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and\nnatural gas field is performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are established. The costs are carried based on the current regulatory\nand political environment or any known changes to that environment. All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial and\nmanagement review on at least an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery. Where this is\nno longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.\nThe carrying amount of capitalized costs are included in Note 8.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment owned by the group is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of\nan asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary\nfor it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if applicable, and, for\nassets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, directly attributable general or specific finance costs. The\npurchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.\nExpenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs.\nWhere an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item\nwill flow to the group, the expenditure is capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced asset is derecognized. Inspection costs associated with major\nmaintenance programmes are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next inspection. Overhaul costs for major maintenance programmes, and\nall other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nExpenditure on the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells,\nincluding service and unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated from the\ncommencement of production.\nOil and natural gas properties, including certain related pipelines, are depreciated using a unit-of-production method. The cost of producing wells is\namortized over proved developed reserves. Licence acquisition, common facilities and future decommissioning costs are amortized over total proved\nreserves. The unit-of-production rate for the depreciation of common facilities takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated\nfuture capital expenditure expected to be incurred relating to as yet undeveloped reserves expected to be processed through these common facilities.\nInformation on the carrying amounts of the group\u2019s oil and natural gas properties, together with the amounts recognized in the income statement as\ndepreciation, depletion and amortization is contained in Note 12 and Note 5 respectively.\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves determined in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including the\napplication of prices using 12-month historical price data in assessing the commerciality of technical volumes, are typically used to calculate depreciation,\ndepletion and amortization charges for the group\u2019s oil and gas properties. Therefore, where this approach is adopted, charges are not dependent on\nmanagement forecasts of future oil and gas prices.\nThe impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected\nfuture production.\nThe estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and bp\u2019s process to manage reserves bookings is described in Supplementary information on oil and natural\ngas on page 223, which is unaudited. Details on bp\u2019s proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes are provided on page 322.\nThe 2024 movements in proved reserves are reflected in the tables showing movements in oil and natural gas reserves by region in Supplementary\ninformation on oil and natural gas (unaudited) on page 223.\nOther property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nThe expected useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful\nlives or the depreciation method are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no\nfuture economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as\nthe difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the period in which the item\nis derecognized.\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and equity-accounted entities\nThe group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs), for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable; for example, changes in the group\u2019s business plans, plans to dispose rather\nthan retain assets, changes in the group\u2019s assumptions about discount rates, commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for\noil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning\ncosts. If any such indication of impairment exists, the group makes an estimate of the asset\u2019s or CGU\u2019s recoverable amount. Individual assets are grouped\ninto CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash\ninflows of other groups of assets. A CGU\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If it is probable that\nthe value of the CGU will be primarily recovered through a disposal transaction, the expected disposal proceeds are considered in determining the\nrecoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its\nrecoverable amount.\nThe business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination\nof value in use. They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, power generation, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of\nrefined products (e.g. gasoline and lubricants), revenues, costs and capital expenditure. Carbon taxes and costs of emissions allowances are included in\nestimates of future cash flows, where applicable, based on the regulatory environment in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. As an initial step in\nthe preparation of these plans, various assumptions regarding market conditions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, power prices, refining margins,\nrefined product margins and cost inflation rates are set by senior management. These assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand\nequilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash\nflows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group to the extent that they are not already reflected in the discount rate and are discounted to their\npresent value typically using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.\nFair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not\nreflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the group and not applicable to entities in general. Fair value may be determined by reference to\nagreed or expected sales proceeds, recent market transactions for similar assets or using discounted cash flow analyses. Where discounted cash flow\nanalyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing\nthe asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or\nmay have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there\nhas been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset\u2019s or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is\nthe case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been\ndetermined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit\nor loss. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset\u2019s or CGU's revised carrying amount, less any residual\nvalue, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of\nCGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to\nwhich goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is less than the carrying\namount (including goodwill), an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\nThe group assesses investments in equity-accounted entities for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired, after\nrecognizing its share of any losses of the equity-accounted entity itself. If any such objective evidence of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the\ninvestment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If the carrying amount\nexceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.\nSignificant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on\nhighly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where\napplicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-\ndemand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, power and refined products. Judgement is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets\ninto a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes. For example, individual oil and gas properties may form separate CGUs\nwhilst certain oil and gas properties with shared infrastructure may be grouped together to form a single CGU. Alternative groupings of assets or CGUs\nmay result in a different outcome from impairment testing. See Note 14 for details on how these groupings have been determined in relation to the\nimpairment testing of goodwill.\nAs described above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of\ndisposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data.\nDetails of impairment charges and reversals recognized in the income statement are provided in Note 4 and details on the carrying amounts of assets\nare shown in Note 12, Note 14 and Note 15.\nThe estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2024 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nDiscount rates\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted\nusing a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a\nmarket participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax\ndiscount rate.\nThe discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2024, the post-tax discount rate was 8% (2023 8%) other than for\nrenewable power assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk, an additional premium of 1% to 3% was reflected in the\npost-tax discount rate (2023 1% to 4%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various\neconomic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for renewable power assets, typically ranged from 9% to 20% (2023 9% to 20%)\ndepending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For renewable power assets, which were tested primarily\non a fair-value basis in 2024 (including those in equity accounted entities) tests were performed using a post-tax cost of equity-based discount rate range\nof 8.75% to 9.5%. In 2023, tests were performed on a value-in-use basis using a post-tax WACC-based discount rate of 6.5%.\nOil and natural gas properties\nFor oil and natural gas properties in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, expected future cash flows are estimated\nusing management\u2019s best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, production and reserves and certain resources volumes. Forecast cash flows\ninclude the impact of all approved emission reduction projects. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions\nabout future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors.\nIn 2024, the group identified oil and gas properties in these segments with carrying amounts totalling $17,853 million (2023 $18,374 million) where the\nheadroom, based on the most recent impairment test performed in the year on those assets, was less than or equal to 20% of the carrying value. A\nchange in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one\nor more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period.\nManagement considers that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices\nand/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year, see Sensitivity analyses, below.\nThe recoverability of intangible exploration and appraisal expenditure is covered under Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development\nexpenditure above.\nOil and natural gas prices\nThe price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp\u2019s carbon emissions cost\nassumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate\nchange and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 145. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice\npresident economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy\ntransition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon\nsupply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the\nscenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\nDuring the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing were revised. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real\n2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per\nbarrel to reflect near term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy\nsystem decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00\nper mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. These price assumptions are derived\nfrom the central case investment appraisal assumptions (see page 20). A summary of the group\u2019s revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub\ngas, applied in 2024 and 2023, in real 2023 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management\u2019s best estimate of future prices at the\nbalance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line\nwith a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average\ntemperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nHowever, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. Inflation rate of 2% - 2.5% (2023 2%) is applied to determine the price\nassumptions in nominal terms.\nThe majority of bp\u2019s reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the group\u2019s existing oil and gas properties are expected to be produced\nover the next 12 years.\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is also affected by the group\u2019s oil and natural gas price assumptions as these could impact the estimate of\nfuture taxable profits.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nGlobal oil production increased by 1.4% in 2024 with this growth predominantly coming from non-OPEC countries as OPEC+ continued its output\nreductions. Global oil demand growth slowed, increasing by 0.9% in 2024 as we leave the post-Covid recovery period and Chinese demand fell short of\nforecasts. Brent dropped by nearly $2 per barrel in 2024 in response to lacklustre demand growth and increasing supply. While geopolitical risk (e.g.,\ntariffs, sanctions) may support prices in the short-term, bp's long-term assumption for oil prices is lower than the 2024 average as oil demand is likely to\nfall such that the price levels needed to encourage sufficient investment to meet global oil demand will also be lower.\nUS Henry Hub spot prices averaged $2.2/mmBtu in 2024 from $2.5/mmBtu in 2023. Prices fell further in order to reduce output and stimulate demand in\nthe power sector. Milder than normal winter weather during winter 2023/2024 left US gas storage levels over 20% above historic average levels at the end\nof winter 2023/2024, causing prices to fall below $2/mmBtu. Meanwhile, after growing by 4 Bcf/d in 2023, low prices caused natural gas production to\nfall by 0.4 Bcf/d in 2024, helping to bring the market back into balance. The level of US gas prices in 2024 was below bp\u2019s long term price assumption\nbased on the judgment of the price level required to incentivize new production.\nOil and natural gas reserves\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the group\u2019s estimated oil and\nnatural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data,\nreservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the group\u2019s estimates of its oil\nand natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial\nassessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\nReserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of\noil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to\nreserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\nSensitivity analyses\nManagement considers discount rates, oil and natural gas prices and production to be the key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining the\nrecoverable amount of upstream oil and gas assets. The sensitivity analyses below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also\nindicate how the energy transition, potential future carbon emissions costs for operational GHG emissions and/or reduced demand for oil and gas may\nfurther impact forecast revenue cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group\u2019s value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs, if\ncarbon emissions costs were to be implemented as a deduction against revenue cash flows. The analyses therefore represent a net revenue sensitivity.\nA change in net revenue from upstream oil and gas properties can arise either due to changes in oil and natural gas prices, carbon emissions costs/\ncarbon prices, changes in oil and natural gas production, or a combination of these.\nManagement tested the impact of changes in net revenue cash flows in value-in-use impairment testing under the following sensitivity analyses: an\nincrease in net revenues of 8% in all years up to 2040, and 25% in all remaining years to 2050; and a decrease in net revenues of 20% in all years up to\n2030, 35% in all subsequent years to 2040 and 50% in all remaining years to 2050.\nNet revenue reductions of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp\u2019s currently held upstream oil and\ngas properties in the range of $19-20 billion which is approximately 30% of the associated net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31\nDecember 2024. If this net revenue reduction was due to reductions in prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative decrease in the carrying amount of using\nprice assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the bottom of the range of prices associated with the World Business Council for Sustainable\nDevelopment (WBCSD) 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nThis \u2018family\u2019 of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario analysis (see page 42).\nNet revenue increases of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to an increase in the carrying amount of bp\u2019s currently held upstream oil and\ngas properties in the range of $1-2 billion which is approximately 2-3% of the associated net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31\nDecember 2024. This potential increase in the carrying amount would arise due to reversals of previously recognized impairments and represents\napproximately one fifth of the total impairment reversal capacity available at 31 December 2024. If this net revenue increase was due to increases in\nprices in isolation, it reflects an indicative increase in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the top end\nuntil 2040, and then towards the mean average at 2050, of the range of prices associated with the WBCSD 'family' of scenarios considered to be\nconsistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This \u2018family\u2019 of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario\nanalysis.\nThese sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management\u2019s best estimate of any impairment charges or reversals that might be recognized as\nthey do not fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and phasing of development. For\nexample, costs across the industry are more likely to decrease as oil and natural gas prices fall. The analyses also assume the impact of increases in\ncarbon price on operational GHG emissions are fully absorbed as a decrease in net revenue (and vice versa) rather than reflecting how carbon prices or\nother carbon emissions costs may ultimately be incorporated by the market. The above sensitivity analyses therefore do not reflect a linear relationship\nbetween net revenue and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and factors plus the diverse characteristics of the group's\nupstream oil and gas properties limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall recoverable amount is impacted by\nchanges to the price assumptions or production volumes.\nManagement also tested the impact of a one percentage point change in the discount rate used for value-in-use impairment testing of upstream oil and\ngas properties. This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year. If the discount\nrate was one percentage point higher across all tests performed, the net impairment loss recognized in 2024 would have been approximately $0.2 billion\nhigher. If the discount rate was one percentage point lower, the net impairment loss recognized would have been approximately $0.5 billion lower.", "page_start": 154, "page_end": 155, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

The\nsensitivity analysis below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also indicates how the energy transition and/or reduced\ndemand for refined products may further impact forecast cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group\u2019s value-in-use estimates\nfor refinery CGUs.\nManagement tested the impact of a $1/barrel decrease in each refinery\u2019s future margin assumption in all years of the value-in-use estimate. A reduction\nof this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp\u2019s currently held refining property, plant and equipment in\nthe range of $1-2 billion.\nThis sensitivity analysis does not, however, represent management\u2019s best estimate of any impairment charges that might be recognized as it does not\nfully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and crude or product slates. The above sensitivity\nanalysis therefore does not reflect a linear relationship between margins and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and\nfactors plus the varying configurations of the group's refineries limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall\nrecoverable amount is impacted by changes to the margin assumptions.\nGoodwill\nIrrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, bp is required to test annually for impairment of goodwill acquired in business\ncombinations. The group carries goodwill of $14.9 billion on its balance sheet (2023 $12.5 billion), principally relating to the Atlantic Richfield, Burmah\nCastrol, Devon Energy, Reliance and Lightsource bp transactions. Of this, $7.2 billion relates to goodwill in the oil production & operations segment and to\nhydrocarbon CGUs within the gas & low carbon energy segment (2023 $7.0 billion), for which oil and gas price and production assumptions are key\nsources of estimation uncertainty. Sensitivities and additional information relating to impairment testing of goodwill in these segments are provided in\nNote 14.\nInventories\nInventories, other than inventories held for short-term trading purposes, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is typically determined\nby the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses. Net realizable value\nis determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date, adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence\nabout their net realizable value at the end of the period.\nInventories held for short-term trading purposes are stated at fair value less costs to sell and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income\nstatement.\nSupplies are valued at the lower of cost on a weighted-average basis and net realizable value.\nLeases\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration are accounted for as leases.\nThe right to control is conveyed if bp has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and the right to direct the use of, the\nidentified asset throughout the period of use. An asset is identified if it is explicitly or implicitly specified by the agreement and any substitution rights held\nby the lessor over the asset are not considered substantive.\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an intangible asset including rights to explore for or use hydrocarbons are not accounted for as\nleases. See material accounting policy information: intangible assets.\nA lease liability is recognized on the balance sheet on the lease commencement date at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term.\nThe discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable, otherwise an incremental borrowing rate is used. For the majority of the\nleases in the group, there is not sufficient information available to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing\nrate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on factors such as the group\u2019s cost of borrowing, lessee legal entity credit risk, currency\nand lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease together with any periods covered by an extension option that bp is reasonably\ncertain to exercise, or periods covered by a termination option that bp is reasonably certain not to exercise. The future lease payments included in the\npresent value calculation are any fixed payments, payments that vary depending on an index or rate, payments due for the reasonably certain exercise of\noptions and expected residual value guarantee payments. Repayments of principal are presented as financing cash flows and payments of interest are\npresented as operating cash flows.\nPayments that vary based on factors other than an index or a rate such as usage, sales volumes or revenues are not included in the present value\ncalculation and are recognized in the income statement and presented as operating cash flows. The lease liability is recognized on an amortized cost basis\nwith interest expense recognized in the income statement over the lease term, except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development\nexpenditure.\nThe right-of-use asset is recognized on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at a value equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease\nliability adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives, initial direct costs and any restoration obligations. The right-of-use asset is depreciated typically\non a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation charge is recognized in the income statement except for where capitalized as exploration,\nappraisal or development expenditure. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment in line with the accounting policy for impairment of property, plant\nand equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.\nAgreements may include both lease and non-lease components. Payments for lease and non-lease components are allocated on a relative stand-alone\nselling price basis except for leases of retail service stations where the group has elected not to separate non-lease payments from the calculation of the\nlease liability and right-of-use asset.\nIf the lease term at commencement of the agreement is less than 12 months, a lease liability and right-of-use asset are not recognized, and a lease\nexpense is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis.", "page_start": 155, "page_end": 156, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nIf a significant event or change in circumstances, within the control of bp, arises that affects the reasonably certain lease term or there are changes to the\nlease payments, the present value of the lease liability is remeasured using the revised term and payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by an\nequivalent amount.\nModifications to a lease agreement beyond the original terms and conditions are accounted for as a re-measurement of the lease liability with a\ncorresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Any gain or loss on modification is recognized in the income statement. Modifications that increase\nthe scope of the lease at a price commensurate with the stand-alone selling price are accounted for as a separate new lease.\nThe group recognizes the full lease liability, rather than its working interest share, for leases entered into on behalf of a joint operation if the group has the\nprimary responsibility for making the lease payments. This may be the case if for example bp, as operator of the joint operation, is the sole signatory to the\nlease agreement. In such cases, bp\u2019s working interest share of the right-of-use asset is recognized if it is jointly controlled by the group and the other joint\noperators, and a receivable is recognized for the share of the asset transferred to the other joint operators. If bp is a non-operator, a payable to the operator\nis recognized if they have the primary responsibility for making the lease payments and bp has joint control over the right-of-use asset, otherwise no\nbalances are recognized.\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through\nprofit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as\nset out below. The group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been\ntransferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and rewards\nof the asset have neither been retained nor transferred but control of the asset has been transferred. This includes the derecognition of receivables for\nwhich discounting arrangements are entered into.\nThe group classifies its financial asset debt instruments as measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value\nthrough profit or loss. The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of\nthe financial asset.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash\nflows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective\ninterest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired\nand when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they are held in a business model the objective of\nwhich is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and\ninterest.\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss when the asset does not meet the criteria to be measured at amortized cost\nor fair value through other comprehensive income. Such assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income\nstatement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.\nInvestments in equity instruments\nInvestments in equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss unless an election is made on an instrument-by-\ninstrument basis to recognize fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income.\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses\narising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\nCash equivalents\nCash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily\nconvertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the\ndate of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value\nthrough profit or loss.\nImpairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost\nThe group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets measured at amortized cost at each balance\nsheet date. Expected credit losses are measured based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. As lifetime\nexpected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the tenor of substantially all other in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is\nno significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses for the group. The measurement of expected credit\nlosses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between\nthe asset\u2019s carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows the group expects to receive discounted at the financial asset\u2019s original effective\ninterest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is adjusted, with the amount of the impairment gain or loss recognized in the income statement.\nA financial asset or group of financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost is considered to be credit-impaired if there is reasonable and\nsupportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or group of\nfinancial assets) have occurred. Financial assets are written off where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering amounts due.\nEquity instruments\nInstruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that\ncannot be settled in the group\u2019s own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange\nfinancial assets or financial liabilities with another entity that are potentially unfavourable are classified as equity.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are recognized when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognizes financial\nliabilities when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their\nclassification, as follows:\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\nFinancial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities are carried on\nthe balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging\ninstruments, are included in this category.\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses\narising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost\nAll other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this\nis typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\nAfter initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is\ncalculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or\ncancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.\nThis category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.\nSignificant judgement: supplier financing arrangements\nThe group\u2019s trade payables include some supplier financing arrangements that utilize letter of credit facilities, promissory notes and reverse factoring.\nJudgement is required to assess the payables subject to these arrangements to determine whether they should continue to be classified as trade\npayables and give rise to operating cash flows or finance debt and financing cash flows. The criteria used in making this assessment include the\npayment terms for the amount due relative to terms commonly seen in the markets in which bp operates and whether the arrangements significantly\nchange the nature of the liability. Liabilities subject to these arrangements with payment terms of up to approximately 60 days are generally considered\nto be trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows. See Note 29 - Liquidity risk for further information.\nFinancial guarantees\nThe group issues financial guarantee contracts to make specified payments to reimburse holders for losses incurred if certain associates, joint ventures or\nthird-party entities fail to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument such as a loan. The liability for a\nfinancial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract\u2019s estimated expected credit loss\nand the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\nDerivative financial instruments and hedging activities\nThe group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and\ncommodity prices, as well as for trading purposes. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which a\nderivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as\nliabilities when the fair value is negative.\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item (for example, oil, oil products, gas or power) that can be settled net in cash, with the exception of contracts\nthat were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the group\u2019s expected\npurchase, sale or usage requirements, are accounted for as financial instruments. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that\nare not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement.\nIf, at inception of a contract, the valuation cannot be supported by observable market data, any gain or loss determined by the valuation methodology is\nnot recognized in the income statement but is deferred on the balance sheet and is commonly known as a \u2018day-one gain or loss\u2019. This deferred gain or loss\nis recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all the remaining contractual cash flows can be valued using\nobservable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Changes in valuation subsequent to the\ninitial valuation at inception of a contract are recognized immediately in the income statement.\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\n\u2022 Fair value hedges when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.\n\u2022 Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or\nliability or a highly probable forecast transaction.\nHedge relationships are formally designated and documented at inception, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the\nhedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, the\nexistence at inception of an economic relationship and subsequent measurement of the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to\nchanges in the hedged item\u2019s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the hedge ratio and sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Hedges\nmeeting the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\nFair value hedges\nThe change in fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being\nhedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss, where it offsets. The group applies fair value\nhedge accounting when hedging interest rate risk and certain currency risks on fixed rate finance debt.\nFair value hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when\nthe risk management objective changes or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised.

Amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction\naffects profit or loss.\nWhere the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, such as a forecast\nforeign currency transaction for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognized within other comprehensive income are\ntransferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. Where the hedged item is an equity investment, the amounts recognized in\nother comprehensive income remain in the separate component of equity until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss or when accounting under the\nequity method is discontinued. Where the hedged item is recognized directly in profit or loss, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are\nreclassified to production and manufacturing expenses or sales and other operating revenues as appropriate.\nCash flow hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when\nthe designated hedged forecast transaction or part thereof is no longer considered to be highly probable to occur, or when the hedging instrument is sold,\nterminated or exercised without replacement or rollover. When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued amounts previously recognized within other\ncomprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to the initial carrying\namount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized within other\ncomprehensive income will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\nCosts of hedging\nThe foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from hedge designations and accounted for as costs of hedging.\nChanges in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread are recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that they relate to the hedged item.\nFor time-period related hedged items, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is amortized to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the\nterm of the hedging relationship.\nFair value measurement\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The group\ncategorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement.\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly,\nother than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant\nmodifications to observable related market data or bp\u2019s assumptions about pricing by market participants.\nSignificant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments\nIn some cases the fair values of derivatives are estimated using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices or other observable, market-\ncorroborated data. This primarily applies to the group\u2019s longer-term derivative contracts. The majority of these contracts are valued using models with\ninputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from available active market pricing data (including volatility and\ncorrelation) and modelled using the maximum available external information. Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are\ndetermined using historical and long-term pricing relationships. The use of alternative assumptions or valuation methodologies may result in significantly\ndifferent values for these derivatives. A reasonably possible change in the price assumptions used in the models relating to index price would not have a\nmaterial impact on net assets and the Group income statement primarily as a result of offsetting movements between derivative assets and liabilities.\nIn some cases, judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell commodities meet the definition of a derivative or to determine\nappropriate presentation and classification of transactions in certain cases. In particular, contracts to buy and sell LNG are not considered to meet the\ndefinition as they are not considered capable of being net settled due to a lack of liquidity in the LNG market and the inability or lack of history of net\nsettlement and are accounted for on an accruals basis, rather than as a derivative. Under IFRS, bp fair values the derivative financial instruments used to\nrisk-manage the LNG contracts themselves, resulting in a measurement mismatch.\nFor more information, including the carrying amounts of level 3 derivatives, see Note 30.\nOffsetting of financial assets and liabilities\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the balance sheet unless both of the following criteria are met: the group currently has a legally\nenforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability\nsimultaneously. A right of set off is the group\u2019s legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the\nsame counterparty. The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties are considered when assessing whether a\ncurrent legally enforceable right to set off exists.\nProvisions and contingencies\nProvisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of\nresources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\nWhere appropriate, the future cash flow estimates are adjusted to reflect risks specific to the liability.\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that\nreflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is\nrecognized within finance costs. Provisions are discounted using a nominal discount rate of 4.5% (2023 4%).\nProvisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled\nlater (non-current).\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the group, or present\nobligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient\nreliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed, if material, unless the possibility of an outflow\nof economic resources is considered remote.", "page_start": 158, "page_end": 159, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nDecommissioning\nLiabilities for decommissioning costs are recognized when the group has an obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility or an\nitem of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Where an obligation exists for a new\nfacility or item of plant, such as oil and natural gas production or transportation facilities, this liability will be recognized on construction or installation.\nSimilarly, where an obligation exists for a well, this liability is recognized when it is drilled. An obligation for decommissioning may also crystallize during\nthe period of operation of a well, facility or item of plant through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations; an obligation may\nalso arise in cases where an asset has been sold but the subsequent owner is no longer able to fulfil its decommissioning obligations, for example due to\nbankruptcy. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and\nrequirements. The provision for the costs of decommissioning wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives is estimated\nusing existing technology, at future prices, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a nominal discount rate.\nAn amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is recognized as part of the corresponding intangible asset (in the case of an exploration or\nappraisal well) or property, plant and equipment. The decommissioning portion of the property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated at the\nsame rate as the rest of the asset. Other than the unwinding of discount on or utilization of the provision, any change in the present value of the estimated\nexpenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset where that asset is generating or is expected to generate future\neconomic benefits.\nEnvironmental expenditures and liabilities\nEnvironmental expenditures that are required in order for the group to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those\nassets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed.\nLiabilities for environmental costs are recognized when a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. Generally, the timing of\nrecognition of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\nThe amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions for environmental liabilities have been\nestimated using existing technology, at future prices and discounted using a nominal discount rate.\nEmissions\nLiabilities for emissions are recognized when the cumulative volumes of gases emitted by the group at the end of the reporting period exceed the\nallowances granted free of charge held for own use or a set baseline for emissions. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure\nrequired to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. It is based on the excess of actual emissions over the free allowances held or set\nbaseline in tonnes (or other appropriate quantity) and is valued at the actual cost of any allowances that have been purchased and held for own use on a\nfirst-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, and, if insufficient allowances are held, for the remaining requirement on the basis of the spot market price of allowances at\nthe balance sheet date. The majority of these provisions are typically settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date however certain schemes may\nhave longer compliance periods. The cost of allowances purchased to cover a shortfall is recognized separately on the balance sheet as an intangible\nasset unless the emission allowances acquired or generated by the group are risk-managed by the trading and shipping function, then they are recognized\non the balance sheet as inventory.\nRestructuring provisions\nRestructuring provisions are recognized where a detailed formal plan exists, and a valid expectation of risk of redundancy has been made to those affected\nbut where the specific outcomes remain uncertain. Where formal redundancy offers have been made, the obligations for those amounts are reported as\npayables and, if not, as provisions if unpaid at the year-end.", "page_start": 159, "page_end": 160, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nSignificant judgements and estimates: provisions\nThe group holds provisions for the future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives.\nThe largest decommissioning obligations facing bp relate to the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal and disposal of oil and natural gas\nplatforms and pipelines around the world. Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will\nhave to be met when the removal event occurs are uncertain. Decommissioning technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are political,\nenvironmental, safety and public expectations. The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty and estimation is\nrequired in determining the amounts of provisions to be recognized. Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and,\nwhere still recognized, the asset.\nIf oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties, judgement is required to assess whether the new owner will be unable to\nmeet their decommissioning obligations, whether bp would then be responsible for decommissioning, and if so the extent of that responsibility. This\ntypically requires assessment of the local legal requirements and the financial standing of the owner. If the standing deteriorates significantly, for\nexample, bankruptcy of the owner, a provision may be required. The group has $0.7 billion of decommissioning provisions recognized as at 31 December\n2024 (2023 $0.6 billion) for assets previously sold to third parties where the sale transferred the decommissioning obligation to the new owner. See Note\n33 for further information.\nDecommissioning provisions associated with refineries are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, given their\nindeterminate settlement dates. Obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations and any such obligations would be recognized in the\nperiod when sufficient information becomes available to determine potential settlement dates. See Note 33 for further information.\nThe group performs periodic reviews of its refineries for any changes in facts and circumstances including those relating to the energy transition, that\nmight require the recognition of a decommissioning provision. Portfolio strength and flexibility are such that the point of cessation of manufacturing at\nthe group\u2019s operating refineries is not yet expected within a determinate time period, as existing property plant and equipment is expected to be renewed\nor replaced.\nThe provision for environmental liabilities is estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology, price levels and expected plans\nfor remediation. Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from current estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations,\nprices, discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean-up technology.\nThe timing and amount of future expenditures relating to decommissioning and environmental liabilities are reviewed annually. The interest rate used in\ndiscounting the cash flows is reviewed quarterly. The nominal interest rate used to determine the balance sheet obligations at the end of 2024 was 4.5%\n(2023 4%), which was based on long-dated US government bonds interpolated to reflect the expected weighted average time to decommissioning. The\nweighted average period over which decommissioning and environmental costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately\n17 years (2023 17 years) and 7 years (2023 6 years) respectively. Costs at future prices are typically determined by applying an inflation rate of 1.5%\n(2023 1.5%) to decommissioning costs and 2% (2023 2%) for all other provisions. A lower rate is typically applied to decommissioning as certain costs\nare expected to remain fixed at current or past prices.\nThe estimated phasing of undiscounted cash flows in real terms for upstream decommissioning is approximately $5.5 billion (2023 $5.5 billion) within\nthe next 10 years, $6.2 billion (2023 $5.8 billion) in 10 to 20 years and the remainder of approximately $6.7 billion (2023 $6.6 billion) after 20 years. The\ntiming and amount of decommissioning cash flows are inherently uncertain and therefore the phasing is management\u2019s current best estimate but may\nnot be what will ultimately occur.\nFurther information about the group\u2019s provisions is provided in Note 23. Changes in assumptions in relation to the group's provisions could result in a\nmaterial change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the nominal discount rate applied could\ndecrease the group\u2019s provision balances by approximately $1.5 billion (2023 $1.6 billion). The pre-tax impact on the group income statement would be a\ncredit of approximately $0.4 billion (2023 $0.4 billion). This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within\nthe next financial year.\nThe discounting impact on the group's decommissioning provisions for oil and gas properties in the oil productions & operations and gas & low carbon\nenergy segments of a two-year change in the timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures is approximately $0.3 billion (2023 $0.6 billion).\nManagement currently does not consider a change of greater than two years to be reasonably possible in the next financial year and therefore the timing\nof upstream decommissioning expenditure is not a key source of estimation uncertainty.\nIf all expected future decommissioning expenditures were 10% higher, then these decommissioning provisions would increase by approximately $1.2\nbillion (2023 $1.1 billion) and a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.4 billion (2023 $0.2 billion) would be recognized. A one percentage point increase in\nthe inflation rate applied to upstream decommissioning costs to determine the nominal cash flows could increase the decommissioning provision by\napproximately $1.7 billion (2023 $1.9 billion) with a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.5 billion (2023 $0.5 billion).\nAs described in Note 33, the group is subject to claims and actions for which no provisions have been recognized. The facts and circumstances relating\nto particular cases are evaluated regularly in determining whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised. Accordingly,\nsignificant management judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.\nEmployee benefits\nWages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are\nrendered by employees of the group. Deferred bonus arrangements that have a vesting date more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are valued\non an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period until the award vests.

The\nmaterial accounting policy information for pensions and other post-employment benefits are described below.\n1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nPensions and other post-employment benefits\nThe cost of providing benefits under the group\u2019s defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which\nattributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value\nof the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result\nof a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-employment benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in\npresent value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the\npresent value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected\nchanges in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts\nincluded in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently\nreclassified to profit and loss.\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of\nthe defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations\nare to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit\npension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions\nto the plan.\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\nSignificant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions and other post-employment benefits involves making significant estimates when measuring the group's pension\nplan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\nPensions and other post-employment benefit assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to\ndetermine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the group's balance sheet and pension and\nother post-employment benefit expense for the following year.\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these\nvariables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and\nnet assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying\namounts of the group's pension and other post-employment benefit obligations within the next financial year. Any differences between these\nassumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation\nused are provided in Note 24.\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in\nequity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined\nin accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or\ndeductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The group\u2019s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws\nthat have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and\ntheir carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except:\n\u2022 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\u2022 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of\nthe transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and\ndeductible temporary differences.\n\u2022 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the\ngroup is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the\nforeseeable future.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is\nprobable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused\ntax losses can be utilized, except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset\nor liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and,\nat the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductive temporary differences.\nIn respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax\nassets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be\navailable against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable or increased to\nthe extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.", "page_start": 161, "page_end": 162, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled,\nbased on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not\ndiscounted.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and\nwhen the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different\ntaxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities\nsimultaneously.\nWhere tax treatments are uncertain, if it is considered probable that a taxation authority will accept the group's proposed tax treatment, income taxes are\nrecognized consistent with the group's income tax filings. If it is not considered probable, the uncertainty is reflected within the carrying amount of the\napplicable tax asset or liability using either the most likely amount or an expected value, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the\nuncertainty.\nThe computation of the group\u2019s income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions\nthroughout the world. The resolution of tax positions taken by the group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take\nseveral years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. Therefore, judgement is required to determine whether\nprovisions for income taxes are required and, if so, estimation is required of the amounts that could be payable.\nIn addition, the group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit.\nHowever, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or\ntax credits can be utilized. Management judgement is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the\namount of future taxable profits that will be available. Such judgements are inherently impacted by estimates affecting future taxable profits such as oil\nand natural gas prices and decommissioning expenditure, see 'Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and\nprovisions'.\nIn July 2023, the UK government enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model rules. The legislation is effective for bp from 1 January 2024 and\nincludes an income inclusion rule and a domestic minimum tax, which together are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each\ncountry in which the group operates. Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. In line with the amendments to IAS 12,\nthe exception from recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes has been applied.\nIn October 2024, the UK government announced changes (effective from 1 November 2024) to the Energy Profits Levy including a 3% increase in the rate\ntaking the headline rate of tax on North Sea profits to 78%, an extension to the period of application of the Levy to 31 March 2030 and the removal of the\nLevy\u2019s main investment allowance. The changes to the rate and to the investment allowance were substantively enacted in 2024 and have been applied in\naccounting for current tax and deferred tax in the year, resulting in an additional non-cash deferred tax charge of approximately $0.1 billion. The extension\nof the Levy to 31 March 2030 was substantively enacted after 31 December 2024 and will result in a non-cash deferred tax charge of around $0.5 billion in\nthe year ended 31 December 2025.\nSignificant judgement and estimate: taxation\nThe value of deferred tax assets and liabilities is an area involving inherent uncertainty and estimation and balances are therefore subject to risk of\nmaterial change as a result of underlying assumptions and judgements used, in particular the forecast of future profitability used to determine the\nrecoverability of deferred tax, for example future oil and gas prices, see \u2018Significant judgement and estimates - Recoverability of asset carrying values\u2019. It\nis impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of profitability assumptions on the group\u2019s deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that\nto the extent that actual outcomes differ from management\u2019s estimates, material income tax charges or credits, and material changes in current and\ndeferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise within the next financial year and in future periods.\nJudgement is required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax (for example, a production tax). The attributes of\nthe tax, including whether it is calculated on profits or another measure such as production or revenues, the extent of deductibility of costs and the\ninteraction with existing income taxes, are considered in determining the classification of the tax. Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes\nas described above but is not applied to other types of taxes; rather such taxes are recognized in the income statement in accordance with the applicable\naccounting policy such as Provisions and contingencies.\nThis judgement is considered significant only in relation to the group\u2019s taxes payable under the fiscal terms of bp\u2019s onshore concession in Abu Dhabi.\nThese are principally reported as income taxes rather than as production taxes.\nFor more information see Note 9 and Note 33.\nCustoms duties and sales taxes\nCustoms duties and sales taxes that are passed on or charged to customers are excluded from revenues and expenses. Assets and liabilities are\nrecognized net of the amount of customs duties or sales tax except:\n\u2022 Customs duties or sales taxes incurred on the purchase of goods and services which are not recoverable from the taxation authority are recognized as\npart of the cost of acquisition of the asset.\n\u2022 Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of customs duty or sales tax included.\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included within receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\nOwn equity instruments \u2013 treasury shares\nThe group\u2019s holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders\u2019 equity. Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased\nand available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to meet the future\nrequirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the\nconsolidated financial statements as treasury shares. The cost of treasury shares subsequently sold or reissued is calculated on a weighted-average\nbasis. Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the\npurchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares. Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not\nshown as treasury shares.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nRevenue and other income\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized when or as the group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good\nor service to a customer. The transfer of control of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG, petroleum and chemical products, and other items usually\ncoincides with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession. The group principally satisfies its performance obligations at a\npoint in time; the amounts of revenue recognized relating to performance obligations satisfied over time are not significant.\nWhen, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that\nperformance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the group expects to be entitled. The transaction price is allocated\nto the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling prices of the goods or services promised.\nContracts for the sale of commodities are typically priced by reference to quoted prices. Revenue from term commodity contracts is recognized based on\nthe contractual pricing provisions for each delivery.

Segmental analysis\nThe group\u2019s organizational structure reflects the various activities in which bp is engaged as well as how performance and resource allocation is evaluated\nby the chief operating decision maker. At 31 December 2024, bp has three reportable segments: Gas & low carbon energy, Oil production & operations, and\nCustomers & products. Each are managed separately, with decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and represent a single operating segment that\ndoes not result from aggregating two or more segments.\nGas & low carbon energy comprises regions with upstream businesses that predominantly produce natural gas, gas marketing and trading activities and\nthe group's solar, wind and hydrogen businesses.\nOil production & operations comprises regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce crude oil.\nCustomers & products comprises the group\u2019s customer-focused businesses, which includes convenience and retail fuels, EV charging, as well as Castrol,\naviation and B2B and midstream. It also includes our products businesses, refining & oil trading, as well as our bioenergya businesses.\nOther businesses and corporate also comprises the group\u2019s shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group\u2019s accounting policies described in Note 1. However, IFRS requires that the\nmeasure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the\npurposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest and\ntax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and lossesb.\nReplacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.\nSales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved. Segment revenues and segment\nresults include transactions between business segments. These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless\nunrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group\nsubsidiary which made the sale. The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of customers & products.\nAll surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-employment benefit plans are allocated to Other\nbusinesses and corporate. However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which\nthe employees work.\nCertain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for bp, and for the UK as this is bp\u2019s country of\ndomicile.\na In February 2025 bp announced its intention to move its biogas business to the gas & low carbon energy segment.\nb Inventory holding gains and losses represent:\n\u2022 the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in\nprovisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting of inventories other than for trading inventories, the cost of\ninventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting\neffect on reported income. The amounts disclosed as inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis (after\nadjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the replacement cost of\ninventory is calculated using data from each operation\u2019s production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach.\n\u2022 an adjustment relating to certain trading inventories that are not price risk managed which relate to a minimum inventory volume that is required to be held to maintain underlying business activities. This\nadjustment represents the movement in fair value of the inventories due to prices, on a grade-by-grade basis, during the period. This is calculated from each operation\u2019s inventory management system on\na monthly basis using the discrete monthly movement in market prices for these inventories.\nThe amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss.

The recoverable amount for the gas businesses and the oil production & operations segment is\nbased on a pre-tax value-in-use calculation. The decrease in headroom for both of these goodwill impairment tests is due to changes in a number of\nassumptions including prices and production as well as, for the oil productions & operations segment, certain tax assumptions and, for the gas\nbusinesses, divestments. The recoverable amount for the LSbp goodwill is based on fair value less costs of disposal.\nNo material impairment of the goodwill balances in either gas & low carbon energy or oil production & operations was recognized during 2024 or 2023.\nFinancial statements\n14. Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill \u2013 continued\nGas businesses and oil production & operations\nThe value in use for relevant CGUs in both the gas businesses and oil production & operations is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the\nprojected production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each field, based on appropriately risked estimates of reserves and\nresources. Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment reviews of goodwill, as\nthey do not represent part of the grouping of CGUs to which the goodwill balances relate and which are used to monitor the goodwill balances for internal\nmanagement purposes. Where such activities form part of wider CGUs to which goodwill relates they are reflected in the test. As the production profile and\nrelated cash flows can be estimated from bp\u2019s past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the\nappropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment in both the gas businesses and oil & production operations. The\nestimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the\nproduction profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the\ncontractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced. As each field has specific reservoir characteristics\nand economic circumstances, the cash flows of each field are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by\nbp management.\nEstimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis, including operating and capital\nexpenditure, are derived from the business segment plans. The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as\npart of bp\u2019s centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.\nThe average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing in the gas businesses over the next 15 years is 154 mmboe per year (2023 185\nmmboe per year) and in the oil production and operations segment is 400 mmboe per year (2023 402 mmboe per year). Production assumptions used for\nthe goodwill impairment tests in both the gas businesses and oil production & operations reflect management\u2019s best estimate of future production of the\nexisting portfolio at the time of the calculation.\nThe weighted average pre-tax discount rate used in the review for the oil production & operations segment is 17%, and 11% for the gas businesses (2023\n17% for the oil production & operations segment and 11% for the gas businesses).\nThe most recent reviews for impairment for the oil production & operations and the gas businesses were carried out in the fourth quarter. The key\nassumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate. The value-in-use calculations\nhave been prepared for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balances were impaired. Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the\nbasis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the tests. The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made. For example, reserves and\nresources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change.\nDue to economic developments, regulatory change and emissions reduction activity arising from climate concern and other factors, future commodity\nprices and other assumptions may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.\nSensitivities to different variables have been estimated using certain simplifying assumptions. For example, lower oil and gas price or production\nsensitivities do not fully reflect the specific impacts for each contractual arrangement and will not capture all favourable impacts that may arise from cost\ndeflation or savings. A detailed calculation at any given price or production profile may, therefore, produce a different result.\nIt is estimated that a 11% (2023 22%) reduction in revenue throughout each year of the remaining life of those assets, either as a result of adverse price or\nproduction conditions or a combination of each, would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-\ncurrent assets of the oil production and operations segment. For the gas businesses a 6% (2023 15%) reduction would have the same result.\nIt is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate of the oil production and operations segment would cause the recoverable amount\nto be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets. For the gas businesses a 2% increase would have this result (2023 no\nreasonably possible change).\nLightsource bp\nThe Lightsource bp goodwill largely relates to the value attributed to the business\u2019s project development capability, including the workforce in place.\nManagement considers the fair value of Lightsource bp at 31 December 2024 to be substantially the same as at the date of acquisition in the fourth\nquarter of 2024.\ncustomers & products\n$ million\n2024 2023\nEuropean European\nCastrol US Fuels Fuels Archaea Other Total Castrol US Fuels Fuels Archaea Other Total\nGoodwill 2,615 828 801 706 553 5,503 2,672 792 839 707 421 5,431\nCash flows for each group of CGUs are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of up to five years, except for Archaea where a\nbusiness plan to 2035 is in place following the acquisition in 2022. To determine the value in use for each of the groups of cash-generating units, cash\nflows for a period of 10 years (11 years for Archaea), are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value. Pre-tax discount rates ranging from 10-12% are\napplied. It is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used in the US Fuels, European Fuels and Archaea goodwill impairment\nassessments would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets.\nNo material impairment of the goodwill balances in customers & products was recognized during 2024 or 2023.\nCastrol\nThe key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Castrol unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount\nrate. Operating margin and sales volumes assumptions used in the detailed impairment review of goodwill calculation are consistent with the assumptions\nused in the Castrol unit\u2019s business plan. A pre-tax discount rate of 9% (2023 9%) is applied in the test.

The amounts payable may differ from the amount provided and the timing of payments is\nuncertain.\nFinancial statements\n24. Pensions and other post-employment benefits\nMost group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Pension\nbenefits may be provided through defined contribution plans (money purchase schemes) or defined benefit plans (final salary and other types of schemes\nwith committed pension benefit payments). For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from\ncontributions paid in respect of each employee. For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employee\u2019s pensionable\nsalary and length of service. Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered\ntrusts.\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-employment benefits\nin Note 1.\nThe defined benefit pension obligation in the UK consists primarily of a closed funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the\nmajority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated\ndirectors, four company-nominated directors, one independent director and one independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is\nrequired by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.\nEmployees in the UK are eligible for membership of defined contribution plans established with third-party providers.\nIn the US, all pension benefits now accrue under a cash balance formula. Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected.\nRetiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement. The plan is funded and its assets are\noverseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee. At the end of 2024 the committee was composed of five bp employees appointed by the president of bp\nCorporation North America Inc. (the appointing officer). The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants\nand is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan. US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined\ncontribution (401k) plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.\nIn the US, group companies also provide post-employment healthcare to eligible retired employees and their dependants (and, in certain legacy cases, life\ninsurance coverage); the entitlement to these benefits is based on the date of hire, the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion\nof a minimum period of service.\nIn the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries. In Germany and France, the majority of\nthe pensions are unfunded. In Germany, the group\u2019s largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core\npension through salary sacrifice. For employees who joined since 2002, the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on\nsuch factors as an employee\u2019s pensionable salary and length of service. The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and\nemployees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law. Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of\nan annuity. The German plans are governed by legal agreements between bp and the works council or between bp and the trade union.\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.\nDuring 2024 the aggregate level of contributions was $69 million (2023 $42 million and 2022 $74 million). The aggregate level of contributions in 2025 is\nexpected to be approximately $150 million and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under\ncontractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.\nFor the primary UK defined benefit plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions\nis agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2026 formal actuarial\nvaluation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2024.\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK defined benefit pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund\nof any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\nMinimum pension funding in the US is determined by legislation and is supplemented by discretionary contributions. No contributions were made into the\nUS pension plan in 2024 and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.\nThe surplus relating to the US pension fund is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that economic benefit can be gained from the surplus through\na reduction in future contributions.\nThere was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2024.\nThe obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-employment benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date\nof the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2024. The UK defined benefit plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years;\nvaluations are required more frequently in many other countries. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the primary UK defined benefit pension plan\nwas as at 31 December 2023.

Rates for the remaining small worldwide plan administered/reported through the\nUK are 5.0% (2023 5.0% and 2022 2.5%) and 1.9% (2023 1.9% and 2022 2.2%) respectively.\nThe discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and for our largest plans in the UK, US and the Eurozone we use yields\nthat reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments. The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference\nbetween the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or\nadvice from the local actuary depending on the information available. The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in\npayment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.\nIn addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice\nin the countries in which we provide pensions and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the\nexperience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. bp\u2019s most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US\nand the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows:\nYears\nMortality assumptions UK US Eurozone\n2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022\nLife expectancy at age 60 for a male currently\naged 60 27.0 27.4 26.9 25.1 25.0 25.0 26.2 26.1 26.0\nLife expectancy at age 60 for a male currently\naged 40 28.9 29.2 28.5 26.8 26.7 26.6 28.6 28.6 28.5\nLife expectancy at age 60 for a female currently\naged 60 29.0 29.2 28.8 28.1 28.1 28.0 29.5 29.3 29.3\nLife expectancy at age 60 for a female currently\naged 40 30.5 30.6 30.6 29.6 29.6 29.5 31.7 31.6 31.4\nPension plan assets are generally held in trusts, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans. The\nassets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\nA proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In\norder to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios\nare highly diversified.\nThe trustee\u2019s long-term investment objective for the primary UK defined benefit plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same\nway as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI)\napproach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability\nassumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money\nusing existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further\nbonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in\nthe table below.\nFor the primary UK defined benefit plan there is an agreement with the trustee to at least maintain the proportion of assets with liability matching\ncharacteristics and review over time. There is a similar agreement in place for the primary US plan.

Capital disclosures and net debt\nThe group defines capital as total equity plus net debt. Our financial framework seeks to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders while\nmaintaining a secure financial base.\nThe group monitors capital on the basis of gearing, that is, the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. Net debt is calculated as finance\ndebt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest\nrate risks relating to finance debt for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt and gearing are non-IFRS measures. bp\nbelieves these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and\ncash and cash equivalents in total.

Fair value gains and losses related to other assets and liabilities classified as measured at fair value\nthrough profit or loss totalled a net gain of $1 million (2023 net loss of $11 million and 2022 net loss of $238 million).

The GFRC is chaired by\nthe CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the EVP supply, trading and shipping and SVPs treasury, tax, accounting reporting control\nand planning & performance management. The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance\nframework for the group. The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the chief executive officer (CEO), and via the CEO to the board, that the\ngroup\u2019s financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in\naccordance with group policies and group risk appetite.\nThe group\u2019s trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the supply, trading and shipping business. Treasury holds\nforeign exchange and interest-rate products in the financial markets to hedge group exposures related to debt and hybrid bond issuance; the compliance,\ncontrol and risk management processes for these activities are managed within the treasury business. All other foreign exchange and interest rate\nactivities within financial markets are performed within the supply, trading and shipping business and are also underpinned by the compliance, control and\nrisk management infrastructure common to the activities of bp\u2019s supply, trading and shipping business. All derivative activity is carried out by specialist\nteams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject to close financial and management control.\nThe supply, trading and shipping business maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operational risk\nassociated with trading activity. A policy and risk committee approves value-at-risk delegations, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies,\nmethodologies and procedures. A commitments committee approves the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.\nIn addition, the supply, trading and shipping business undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described\nmore fully below.\n(a) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business. The primary\ncommodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the group\u2019s financial\nassets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its\nordinary business exposures. In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management\npurposes.\nThe major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.\n(i) Commodity price risk\nThe group\u2019s supply, trading and shipping business is responsible for delivering value across the overall crude, oil products, gas, LNG and power supply\nchains. As such, it routinely enters into spot and term physical commodity contracts in addition to optimising physical storage, pipeline and transportation\ncapacity. These activities expose the group to commodity price risk which is managed by entering into oil, natural gas and power swaps, options and\nfutures.\nThe group measures market risk exposure arising from its risk managed trading positions using value-at-risk techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation\nmodels. These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding\nperiod within a 95% confidence level.

Financial instruments and financial risk factors \u2013 continued\nall trading activity. The calculation of potential changes in value within the risk managed period considers positions, historical price movements and the\ncorrelation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is maintained. The value-at-\nrisk measure is supplemented by stress testing and scenario analysis through simulating the financial impact of certain physical, economic and geo-\npolitical scenarios. The value-at-risk measure in respect of the aggregated risk managed trading positions at 31 December 2024 was $42 million (2023 $26\nmillion) whereas the average value-at-risk measure for the period was $35 million (2023 $49 million). This measure incorporates the effect of\ndiversification reflecting the offsetting risks across the trading portfolio. Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are not risk managed\nand for which value-at-risk techniques are not appropriate.\n(ii) Foreign currency exchange risk\nSince bp has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the group\u2019s reported results and future\nexpenditure commitments. The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost\ncompetitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions. For this reason, the\ntotal effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the group\u2019s reported results. The main underlying economic currency of the\ngroup\u2019s cash flows is the US dollar. This is because bp\u2019s major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars. bp\u2019s foreign currency exchange\nmanagement policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar. The group co-\nordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible and then\nmanaging any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.\nMost of the group\u2019s borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar. At 31 December 2024, the total foreign currency borrowings\nnot swapped into US dollars amounted to $555 million (2023 $309 million). The group also has in issue perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in euro,\nsterling and US dollars. Whilst the contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal\nindefinitely, the group has chosen to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods.\nThe group manages the net residual foreign currency exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage\nsuch risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million. At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the\nmaximum risk limit. A continuous assessment is made in respect of the group\u2019s foreign currency exposures to capture hedging requirements.\nDuring the year, hedge accounting was applied to foreign currency exposure to highly probable forecast capital expenditure commitments. The group fixes\nthe US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards for the highly probable forecast capital expenditure. At 31 December 2024 the\nmost significant open contracts in place were for USD equivalent amounts of $92 million sterling (2023 $296 million sterling).\nWhere the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-at-risk\ntechniques as explained in (i) commodity price risk above.\n(iii) Interest rate risk\nbp is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial\ninstruments, principally finance debt. While the group issues debt and hybrid bonds in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses\nderivatives to swap the economic exposure to a floating rate basis, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar\nfixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt. The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2024 was 30% of total finance\ndebt outstanding (2023 35%). The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2024 was 5% (2023 5%) and the weighted average\nmaturity of fixed rate debt was eight years (2023 thirteen years).\nThe group\u2019s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the element of the group\u2019s finance debt that is contractually floating rate or has been\nswapped to floating rates. If the interest rates applicable to these floating rate instruments of $18,006 million (2023 $18,238 million) (see Note 26) were to\nhave changed by one percentage point on 1 January 2025, it is estimated that the group\u2019s finance costs for 2025 would change by approximately $180\nmillion (2023 $182 million).\n(b) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the\ngroup and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit\nexposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables. Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which\nthe outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2024 was $655 million (2023 $1,655 million) in respect of\nliabilities of joint ventures and associates and $585 million (2023 $598 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. An amount of $146 million\n(2023 $201 million) is recorded as a liability at 31 December 2024 in relation to these guarantees. For all guarantees, maturity dates vary, and the\nguarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the obligation.

Financial instruments and financial risk factors \u2013 continued\nThe group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO, that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and\ncontrol credit risk. Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business. On entering into any business contract the extent to which\nthe arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered. Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any\nsales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk; the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty\nexposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported; and the timely identification and reporting of any non-\napproved credit exposures and credit losses. While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group\npolicy, treasury holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.\nFor the purposes of financial reporting the group calculates expected loss allowances based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is\nexposed to credit risk. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the credit risk associated with the significant majority of\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost is considered to be low. Since the tenor of substantially all of the group's in-scope financial assets is less than\n12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses. Expected loss allowances for\nfinancial guarantee contracts are typically lower than their initial fair value less, where appropriate, amortization. Financial assets are considered to be\ncredit-impaired when there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash\nflows of the financial asset have occurred. This includes observable data concerning significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; a breach of\ncontract; concession being granted to the counterparty for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty\u2019s financial difficulty, that would\nnot otherwise be considered; it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial re-organization or an active market for the\nfinancial asset disappearing because of financial difficulties. The group also applies a rebuttable presumption that an asset is credit-impaired when\ncontractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a\nportion thereof, for example where all legal avenues for collection of amounts due have been exhausted, the financial asset (or relevant portion) is written\noff.\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss after recovery if\nthere is a default) and the exposure at default (i.e. the asset's carrying amount). The group allocates a credit risk rating to exposures based on data that is\ndetermined to be predictive of the risk of loss, including but not limited to external ratings. Probabilities of default derived from historical, current and\nfuture-looking market data are assigned by credit risk rating with a loss given default based on historical experience and relevant market and academic\nresearch applied by exposure type. Experienced credit judgement is applied to ensure probabilities of default are reflective of the credit risk associated with\nthe group's exposures. Credit enhancements that would reduce the group's credit losses in the event of default are reflected in the calculation when they\nare considered integral to the related asset.\nThe maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount. The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but\nexpects to experience a certain level of credit losses. As at 31 December 2024, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate\napproximately $9.2 billion (2023 $12.0 billion) of credit risk of which approximately $8.2 billion (2023 $10.7 billion) related to assets in the scope of IFRS 9's\nimpairment requirements. Credit enhancements include standby and documentary letters of credit, bank guarantees, insurance and liens which are\ntypically taken out with financial institutions who have investment grade credit ratings, or are liens over assets held by the counterparty of the related\nreceivables.

The group\u2019s liquidity is managed centrally\nwith operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function. Unless restricted by local regulations, generally\nsubsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to the treasury function, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries\u2019 requirements, or invest any net surplus in\nthe market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the group\u2019s overall net currency positions. While there is the potential for\nconcerns about the energy transition to impact banks\u2019 or debt investors\u2019 appetite to finance hydrocarbon activity, we do not anticipate any material change\nto the group's funding or liquidity in the short to medium term as a result of such concerns.\nThe group benefits from open credit provided by suppliers who generally sell on five to 60-day payment terms in accordance with industry norms. bp\nutilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow. This includes discounting of receivables and, in the\nsupply and trading businesses, managing inventory, collateral and supplier payment terms within a maximum of 60 days.\nIt is normal practice in the oil and gas supply and trading business for customers and suppliers to utilize letters of credit (LCs) facilities to mitigate credit\nand non-performance risk. Consequently, LCs facilitate active trading in a global market where credit and performance risk can be significant. In common\nwith the industry, bp routinely provides LCs to some of its suppliers.\nThe group has committed LC facilities totalling $12,130 million (2023 $13,180 million), allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum 24-month duration. The\nfacilities are held with 16 international banks.\nIn certain circumstances, the supplier has the option to request accelerated payment from the LC provider in order to further reduce their exposure. bp\u2019s\npayments are made to the provider of the LC rather than the supplier according to the original contractual payment terms. At 31 December 2024, a portion\nof the group\u2019s trade payables which were subject to the LC arrangements were payable to LC providers, with no material exposure to any individual\nprovider. If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that payment terms were shorter.\nThe group sometimes uses promissory notes to pay its suppliers and other counterparties. This is primarily done to facilitate the counterparty accelerating\nits cash inflow without also accelerating the group\u2019s related cash outflow. For instance, if a supplier to the group\u2019s supply, trading and shipping business\nwould like prepayment or early-payment for a supply of goods, the group may issue a promissory note (payable at a future date) in favour of that supplier\non the supplier\u2019s desired cash inflow date, which that supplier can then convert to cash by selling it to a finance provider on the same-day. The majority of\npromissory notes the group issues accrue interest on the principal amount of the note at a fixed rate stated on the note from issuance to maturity. This is\ndone to give the supplier or other counterparty certainty about the amount they will receive when they sell the note. It also gives the group flexibility to\nselect the maturity date of the note without that impacting the net present value of the note on its issuance date. The maturity date the group selects for\nany promissory note that is for the purchase of goods by its supply and trading business will be no more than 60 days after the group takes (or expects to\ntake) title to those goods.\nA portion of the group's trade payables form part of a reverse factoring arrangement with select suppliers.\nSuppliers\u2019 participation in the reverse factoring arrangement is voluntary. Suppliers that participate have the option to receive early payment on invoices\nfrom the group\u2019s external finance provider. If suppliers choose to receive early payment, they pay a fee to the finance provider. If they opt not to receive\nearly payment, they will pay no fee to the finance provider and will be paid the full invoice amount on the invoice due date. The group provides data about\ninvoices subject to the arrangement directly to the finance provider. This data includes the invoice due date and the maturity date for each invoice. The\ninvoice due date is the date the supplier would have been entitled to receive payment from the group had the invoice not been made subject to the reverse\nfactoring arrangement. The maturity date, which is the date the group will settle that invoice by paying the finance provider, will, in some cases, be the\nsame as the invoice due date. In other cases, it will be a date selected by the group that is no more than 60 days after the group has taken title to the goods\nto which the invoice relates. If the group selects a maturity date that is after the invoice due date, the group pays the finance provider a fee.\nManagement does not consider the reverse factoring arrangement to result in excessive concentrations of liquidity risk, in part because the finance\nprovider has the option to (and does) sub-participate portions of the financings to other finance providers. The arrangements have been established for a\nvariety of reasons, including to ease the administrative burden of managing high volumes of invoices from some suppliers, to facilitate some suppliers\nhaving the option to accelerate when they receive payment or, often at a lower cost than that supplier\u2019s usual cost of borrowing, and, in some cases, to\nmanage the working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow of the group\u2019s supply and trading business. The group has not derecognised the original\ntrade payables relating to the arrangements because the original liability is not substantially modified on entering into the arrangements.", "page_start": 200, "page_end": 201, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

In addition the group issued\nperpetual hybrid capital bonds and securities with a US dollar equivalent value of $4.3 billion (2023 $0.2 billion). Commercial paper is issued at competitive\nrates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.\nAs a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $39.2 billion at 31 December\n2024 (2023 $33.0 billion), primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice. As at 31\nDecember 2024, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of an undrawn committed $8.0 billion credit\nfacility and $4.0 billion of standby facilities. $7.8 billion of the credit facility was available for one year and $0.2 billion was available for less than 1 year.\n$3.9 billion of the standby facilities were available for 3 years and $0.1 billion were available for 2 years. These facilities were unutilized and were held with\n27 international banks.

The amounts reflect the gross\nsettlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US\ndollar finance debt or hybrid bonds.

Derivative financial instruments\nIn the ordinary course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its normal business exposures in relation\nto commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt,\nconsistent with its risk management policies and objectives. An outline of the group\u2019s financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to\nthose risks is set out in Note 29. Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with\nthese activities using a similar range of contracts.\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.\nExchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date.

Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and\nentrepreneurial trading. They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair\nvalued under accounting standards. These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement. Also included\nwithin this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes. The total amount relating to all these items was a net gain of $9,726\nmillion (2023 $19,786 million net gain). This number does not include gains and losses on the change in value of contracts which are not recognized under\nIFRS such as transportation and storage contracts, but does include the associated financially settled contracts. The net amounts for actual gains and\nlosses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\nAs outlined in Note 1 - Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments, LNG contracts are only recognised in the financial statements\nwhen associated cargoes are lifted. The embedded value in these contracts is not recognised and is subject to underlying commodity price volatility. bp\ngenerally price risk manages the exposure to LNG cargoes due for delivery in the near term where there is a liquid market. It does so on a portfolio basis\nusing derivative instruments amongst other price risk management strategies. Under IFRS, these derivative instruments, which are subject to similar price\nvolatility, are recorded at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting period, which creates an accounting mismatch in the financial statements\nbetween the accounting for LNG contracts and the derivatives used for risk management. For the year ended 31 December 2024, there were no material\ngains or losses recorded on the associated derivative positions. For the year ended 31 December 2023, there were material gains recognized on the\nassociated derivative positions due to the movement in the underlying commodity prices. . For additional information, details of management\u2019s internal\nmeasure of performance are given in the Group Performance Report on page 24 and on page 314.\nThe group also enters into derivative contracts relating to foreign currency risk management activities including contracts that the group has entered into\nto manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The change in the unrealized value\nof these contracts was a net loss of $404 million (2023 $632 million net gain and 2022 $1,280 million net loss). Where the derivative is economically\nhedging finance debt, gains and losses on such derivative contracts are included within finance costs. Where the derivative is managing non-US hybrid\nbond exposure gains and loss are included within production and manufacturing expenses. Where these gains and losses arise on derivatives hedging\nfinance debt they are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt. The net amounts\nfor actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\nCash flow hedges\n(i) Foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast capital expenditure\nAt 31 December 2024, the group held currency forwards designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of highly probable forecast\nnon-US dollar capital expenditure. Note 29 outlines the group\u2019s approach to foreign currency exchange risk management. When the highly probable\nforecast capital expenditure designated as a hedged item occurs, a non-financial asset is recognized and is presented within the fixed asset section of the\nbalance sheet.\nThe group claims hedge accounting only for the spot value of the currency exposure in line with the strategy to fix the volatility in the spot exchange rate\nelement.

Derivative financial instruments \u2013 continued\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an\neconomic relationship is determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged\nitem. The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the currency and notional of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is\ndetermined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional designated on the forecast transaction. The group determines the extent\nto which it hedges highly probable forecast capital expenditures on a project by project basis.\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\u2022 counterparty's credit risk, the group mitigates counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with high credit quality counterparties; and\n\u2022 differences in settlement timing between the derivative and hedged items. The latter impacts the discount factor used in the calculation of the hedge\nineffectiveness. The group mitigates differences in timing between the derivatives and hedged items by applying a rolling strategy and by hedging\ncurrency pairs from stable economies. The group's cash flow hedge designations are highly effective as the sources of ineffectiveness identified are\nexpected to result in minimal hedge ineffectiveness.\nThe group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.\n(ii) Commodity price risk of highly probable forecast sales\nDuring the period the group held Henry Hub NYMEX futures designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of certain highly probable\nforecast future sales. Henry Hub NYMEX futures are subject to daily settlement, where their fair value at the end of each day is required to be cash settled,\nsuch that the carrying amount of these hedging instruments within continuing hedge relationships is always zero at the end of each day.\nThe group is exposed to the variability in the gas price, but only applied hedge accounting to the risk of Henry Hub price movements for a percentage of\nfuture gas sales from its BPX Energy business.\nThe group applied hedge accounting in relation to these highly probable future sales where there was an economic relationship between the hedged item\nand hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship was determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the\nhedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group entered into hedging derivatives that matched the notional amounts of the hedged items on a\n1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio was determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount designated on the\nforecast transaction.\nThe hedge was highly effective due to the price index of the hedging instruments matching the price index of the hedged item.

Note 29 outlines the group\u2019s approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk\nmanagement. The interest rate swaps are used to convert US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt. The cross-currency interest\nrate swaps are used to convert sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone denominated fixed rate\nborrowings into US dollar floating rate debt. The group manages all risks derived from debt issuance, such as credit risk, however, the group applies hedge\naccounting only to certain components of interest rate and foreign currency risk in order to minimize hedge ineffectiveness. The interest rate and foreign\ncurrency exposures are identified and hedged on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\nFor interest rate exposures, the group designates as a fair value hedge the benchmark interest rate component only. This is an observable and reliably\nmeasurable component of interest rate risk. For foreign currency exposures, the group excludes from the designation the foreign currency basis spread\ncomponent implicit in the cross-currency interest rate swaps. This is separately calculated at hedge designation, is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome over the life of the hedge and amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis, in accordance with the group\u2019s policy on costs of\nhedging.\nFinancial statements\n30. Derivative financial instruments \u2013 continued\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an\neconomic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively\nassessed using linear regression analysis. The group issues fixed rate debt and enters into interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps with critical\nterms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with\nthe notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt. Both the hedging instrument and the\nhedged item are expected to be held to maturity.\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\u2022 derivative counterparty\u2019s credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is mitigated by entering into derivative transactions only with high\ncredit quality counterparties; and\n\u2022 sensitivity to interest rate between the hedged item and the derivatives. This is driven by differences in payment frequencies between the instrument\nand the bond.\nThe tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.

Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally\nto employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders\u2019 equity.

The accumulated amount relates to time-period related hedged items and is amortized to profit or loss over the term of the hedging relationship.\nFor further information on the accounting for costs of hedging see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\nProfit and loss account\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the group.\nNon-controlling interests\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within non-\ncontrolling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds, perpetual subordinated hybrid securities and certain equity instruments with preferred\ndistributions issued by group subsidiaries. The contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments, equity distributions and\nrepayment of principal indefinitely. However, the terms and conditions of each instrument stipulate the circumstances in which deferred payments and/or\nthe principal amount of the instrument becomes payable. These circumstances, which include the announcement of a bp p.l.c. ordinary share or parity\nequity dividend distribution, are within the group\u2019s control.\nPerpetual subordinated hybrid bonds are issued by BP Capital Markets p.l.c., a group subsidiary, in euro, sterling and US dollars. During the year BP Capital\nMarkets p.l.c. voluntarily bought back $1.3 billion of the non-call 2025 4.375% US dollar hybrid bonds issued in 2020 and issued euro, sterling and US dollar\nhybrid bonds for a US dollar equivalent amount of $3.9 billion. Coupons on the new issuances are fixed for an initial period up to dates from 2030 to 2035\nat rates of 4.375% to 6.45%. As at 31 December 2024 the total population of hybrid bonds include redemption options exercisable at the group\u2019s discretion\nfrom June 2025 to March 2035 (the first \u2018call date\u2019), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or\ntax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue. Coupons are fixed for an initial period up to dates from September 2025 to June 2035 at rates\nof 3.25% to 6.45% and reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. Whilst the contractual terms of\nthese instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, the group has chosen to swap the non-US dollar\nhybrid bonds to a USD floating interest rate up to their respective first call periods. Payments made to and profit attributed to these hybrid bonds in the\nyear totalled $485 million (2023 $477 million) and $517 million (2023 $473 million) respectively. The amount of hybrid bonds included in non-controlling\ninterests at the end of the year was $14.6 billion (2023 $12.1 billion).\nPerpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by group subsidiaries include $500 million issued during 2024, specifically earmarked to fund BP\nAlternative Energy Investments Ltd including the funding of Lightsource bp. Payments made to and profit attributed to perpetual hybrid securities in the\nyear totalled $125 million (2023 $114 million) and $125 million (2023 $113 million) respectively. The amount of perpetual subordinated hybrid securities\nincluded within non-controlling interests at the end of the year was $2.0 billion (2023 $1.5 billion).\nEquity instruments with preferred distributions issued by group subsidiaries include $1,330 million issued during 2024 comprising $500 million of proceeds\nfrom the sale of a 49% interest in a subsidiary that holds certain midstream assets offshore US; and $830 million of proceeds from the sale of a 25% non-\ncontrolling interest in BP Pipelines TAP Limited, the bp subsidiary that holds a 20% share in Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG. In both transactions, the group\nretains control over the ability to defer equity distributions which are not guaranteed, and investors have no right to redeem their shares other than in\ncertain circumstances that are within the group\u2019s control.

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\nContingent liabilities\nThere were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2024 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the group\u2019s\nbusiness. No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 29.\nIn the normal course of the group\u2019s business, bp group entities are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of current and past operations,\nincluding matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general\nhealth, safety, climate change and environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint,\nasbestos and other chemicals. The amounts claimed could be significant and could be material to the group\u2019s results of operations, financial position or\nliquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp expects that the impact of current legal and regulatory proceedings on the\ngroup\u2018s results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.\nThe group files tax returns in many jurisdictions across the world. Various tax authorities are currently examining these returns, which contain matters that\ncould be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. The resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax\nauthorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete and the amounts could be significant and could, in aggregate, be material to the\ngroup\u2019s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings \u2013 continued\nThe group is subject to numerous national and local health, safety and environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other\nactivities. These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release\nof chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil\nfields, commodities extraction sites, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites. In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset\nsales or closed facilities. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its costs are inherently difficult to estimate. However, the estimated cost of\nenvironmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the group\u2018s accounting policies. While the amounts of future possible\ncosts that are not provided for could be significant and material to the group\u2018s results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not\npossible to estimate the amounts involved. bp does not expect these costs to have a material impact on the group\u2019s results of operations, financial\nposition or liquidity.\nIf production and manufacturing facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning\nobligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, bp could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning. The group estimates that for\nproduction facilities, approximately $16 billion (2023 $16 billion) of associated decommissioning obligations were previously transferred to third parties.\nWhile the amounts associated with decommissioning provisions reverting to the group could be material, bp is not currently aware of any such material\ncases that have a greater than remote chance of reverting to the group. Furthermore, as described in Provisions and contingencies within Note 1,\ndecommissioning provisions associated with customers & products facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured\ngiven their indeterminate settlement dates.\nBy their nature, it is not practicable to estimate the potential financial impact or possible timing of the above contingencies as there are significant\nuncertainties that are dependent on various factors that are not within the group\u2019s control.\nContingent liabilities related to the Gulf of America oil spill\nFor information on legal proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, see Legal proceedings below. Any outstanding Deepwater Horizon related\nclaims are not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial performance.\nLegal proceedings\nProceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill\nIntroduction\nBP Exploration & Production Inc. (BPXP) was lease operator of Mississippi Canyon, Block 252 in the Gulf of America, where the semi-submersible rig\nDeepwater Horizon was deployed at the time of the 20 April 2010 explosion and fire and resulting oil spill (the Incident). Lawsuits and claims arising from\nthe Incident were brought principally in US federal and state courts. The remaining proceedings arising from the Incident are discussed below.\nMedical Benefits Class Action Settlement\nIn 2012 the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement (Medical Settlement) was entered into with the plaintiffs steering committee. It includes an exclusive\nremedy provision regarding class members pursuing exposure-based personal injury claims for later-manifested physical conditions (LMPCs). As of 31\nDecember 2024, there were 26 pending lawsuits brought by class members claiming LMPCs.\nOther civil complaints \u2013 personal injury\nThe vast majority of post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury claims from individuals that either opted out of the Medical\nSettlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been dismissed (including more than 620 cases in which the courts granted BPXP\u2019s motions\nfor summary judgment). As of 31 December 2024, 38 cases remained pending in the district courts.\nNon-US government lawsuits\nTwo class actions are pending in Mexican Federal District Courts against various bp group entities including BPXP and BP America Production Company\nby separate plaintiff classes. Although the two actions are separate, both broadly seek penalties, damages and compensation for alleged environmental,\nhealth and economic harm in Mexico as a result of the Incident. One of the actions also seeks an order requiring the bp defendants to repair alleged\ndamage to Mexican waters and land.\nbp has answered the complaints in both actions by seeking dismissal on various grounds including that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there\nwas no economic or environmental harm in Mexico.\nThese legal actions remain at a relatively early stage and while it is not possible to predict the outcome, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends\nto defend such actions vigorously.", "page_start": 219, "page_end": 220, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings \u2013 continued\nOther legal proceedings\nClimate change\nBP p.l.c., BP America Inc. and BP Products North America Inc. are co-defendants with other oil and gas companies in approximately 30 lawsuits brought in\nvarious state and federal courts on behalf of various governmental and private parties. The lawsuits generally assert claims under a variety of legal\ntheories seeking to hold the defendant companies responsible for impacts allegedly caused by and/or relating to climate change. Underlying many of the\nlegal theories are allegations regarding deceptive communication and disinformation to the public. The lawsuits seek remedies including payment of\nmoney and other forms of equitable relief. If such suits were successful, the cost of the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial.\nDefendants spent several years seeking to have the cases removed to federal courts, however Defendants\u2019 attempts were ultimately unsuccessful.\nAccordingly, the cases are proceeding in various state courts. As a group, the lawsuits generally remain at relatively early stages in the litigation process.\nWhile it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.\nLouisiana Coastal restoration\nSix coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed over 40 separate lawsuits in state courts in Louisiana against various oil and gas companies\nseeking damages for coastal erosion. bp entities were named defendants in 17 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants' historical\noperations in oil and gas fields within the Louisiana onshore coastal zone failed to comply with state permits and/or were conducted without the required\ncoastal use permits. The scope and scale of plaintiffs\u2019 damages demands are significant and unprecedented, including substantial remediation costs,\nnatural resource (ecological impact) damages and the claimed costs for restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil and gas field operations.\nDefendants removed all of these lawsuits to federal court and the removals were contested by plaintiffs, eventually resulting in a decision from the US Fifth\nCircuit Court of Appeals rejecting defendants\u2019 \u201cfederal officer\u201d jurisdiction removal grounds in one of two lead cases \u2013 Plaquemines Parish v. Riverwood, et\nal. Defendants\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari to the US Supreme Court seeking review of the US Fifth Circuit\u2019s Riverwood decision was denied in early 2023.\nIn 2024, the US Fifth Circuit issued a further final ruling rejecting \u201cfederal officer\u201d jurisdiction in a subset of the removed cases contested on a related\nremoval theory and remanded all such cases to state district court.\nFollowing remand of the other lead removal case, Cameron Parish v. Auster, et. al., in which bp was the principal defendant, bp entered into a settlement\nagreement and release with the plaintiffs in late 2023 in respect of all state and local governmental claims arising within Cameron Parish. The terms of the\nsettlement agreement and release are confidential and have not had and are not expected to have in the future, a significant effect on the company\u2019s\nfinancial position or profitability.\nAtlantic Richfield Company, a bp affiliate, was a named defendant along with other oil & gas companies in a case, Plaquemines Parish v. Rozel, et al, set for\ntrial in March 2025. A state trial court in December 2024 ruled in favour of Atlantic Richfield\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed it from the\ncase, but following a motion by plaintiffs for reconsideration, the court reversed its summary judgment ruling and reinstated Atlantic Richfield as a\ndefendant. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Atlantic Richfield have been severed from the initial March 2025 trial date, and the court has yet to establish a new\ntrial date for the plaintiffs\u2019 now separate claims against Atlantic Richfield.\nNo bp entity is a named defendant in any of the other active Louisiana Coastal restoration docket cases with a trial date, all of which remain in the early\nstages of litigation. In addition, four private landowners have filed separate claims in the state courts in Jefferson and Plaquemines Parishes of Louisiana\nfor restoration damages related to alleged impacts to their marshlands associated with historic oil field operations. bp entities are defendants in two of\nthese private landowner cases, having been previously dismissed from a third.\nWhile it is not possible to predict the outcomes of these novel legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions\nvigorously.", "page_start": 220, "page_end": 221, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Events after the reporting period\nOn 26 February 2025, bp announced a fundamentally reset strategy, with significant capital reallocation, and plans to drive improved performance, aimed\nat growing free cash flow, returns and long-term shareholder value. This strategy will see bp grow its upstream oil and gas business, focus its downstream\nbusiness, and invest with increasing discipline into the transition. It builds on bp\u2019s distinct strengths and competitive advantages as an integrated energy\ncompany. There are no impacts on these financial statements related to the strategy announcements in accordance with IAS 10 \u2018Events after the reporting\nperiod\u2019.\nFinancial statements\nSupplementary information on oil and natural gas (unaudited)\nThe regional analysis presented below is on a continent basis, with separate disclosure for countries that contain 15% or more of the total proved reserves\n(for subsidiaries plus equity-accounted entitiesa), in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements.\nOil and gas reserves \u2013 certain definitions\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, the following terms have the meanings shown below:\nProved oil and gas reserves\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable\ncertainty to be economically producible \u2013 from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods,\nand government regulations \u2013 prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is\nreasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must\nhave commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:\n(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any; and\n(B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically\nproducible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.\n(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration\nunless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.\n(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap,\nproved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and\nreliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.\n(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are\nincluded in the proved classification when:\n(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favourable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of\nan installed programme in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty\nof the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based; and\n(B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.\n(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the\naverage price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic\naverage of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding\nescalations based upon future conditions.\nUndeveloped oil and gas reserves\nUndeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing\nwells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production\nwhen drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.\n(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are\nscheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.\n(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other\nimproved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an\nanalogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.\nDeveloped oil and gas reserves\nDeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:\n(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared\nto the cost of a new well; and\n(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not\ninvolving a well.\nFor details on bp\u2019s proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes, see pages 318-326.\na See Note 1 - Investment in Rosneft.", "page_start": 223, "page_end": 225, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next\nfinancial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.\nFinancial statements\n1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nJudgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the financial statements. These may have significant impacts\non the currently reported amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities discussed below.\nImpairment of investments\nThe recoverable amounts of the Company\u2019s investments in subsidiaries are closely linked to the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and\ngoodwill in the individual subsidiaries. The energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn\nmay affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management\u2019s best estimate of oil and\nnatural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing were revised during 2024. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real\n2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per\nbarrel to reflect near-term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy\nsystem decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00\nper mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. The revised assumptions for Brent oil\nand Henry Hub gas sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with\nthe temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-\nindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nJudgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards\nto the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment.\nGoing concern\nLiquidity and financing is managed within bp under pooled group-wide arrangements which include the Company. As part of assuring the going concern\nbasis of preparation for the Company, the ability and intent of the bp group to support the Company has been taken into consideration. The most recent\nbp group financial statements (see pages 115 to 222) continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a\nnumber of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the\ngroup will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements even if the\nBrent price fell to zero. In addition, group management of bp have confirmed that the existing intra-group funding and liquidity arrangements as currently\nconstituted are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, being no less than twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. No\nmaterial uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. Accordingly, the Company will be\nable to draw on support from the bp group for the foreseeable future and these financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern\nbasis.\nPensions\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2024 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of\ndefined benefit obligations in the group\u2019s defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and Note 4 for further information.\nInvestments\nInvestments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable\namount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its\nrecoverable amount. Where these circumstances have reversed, the impairment previously made is reversed to the extent of the original cost of the\ninvestment.\nSignificant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an investment holding company chain (defined as each direct subsidiary and its own investments), is\nimpaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount\nrates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the\noutlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Determination as to whether, and by\nhow much, an asset or CGU is impaired involves similar estimates.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be\ndetermined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data. Details of impairment charges recognized in the profit and loss\naccount and the carrying amounts of investments are shown in Note 2. The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2024 relating to\ndiscount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nDiscount rates\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted\nusing a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the Company derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and\nincorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a\npost-tax discount rate.\nThe discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2024, the post-tax discount rate was 8% (2023 8%) other than for\nrenewable power assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk, an additional premium of 1% to 3% was reflected in the\npost-tax discount rate (2023 1% to 4%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various\neconomic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for renewable power assets, typically ranged from 9% to 20% (2023 9% to 20%)\ndepending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For renewable power assets, which were tested primarily\non a fair-value basis in 2024 (including those in equity accounted entities) tests were performed using a post-tax cost of equity-based discount rate range\nof 8.75% to 9.5%. In 2023, tests were performed on a value-in-use basis using a post-tax WACC-based discount rate of 6.5%.\nOil and natural gas properties\nFor upstream oil and natural gas properties in subsidiaries, expected future cash flows are estimated using management\u2019s best estimate of future oil and\nnatural gas prices, and production and reserves and certain resources volumes. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based\non assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors. A\nchange in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one\nor more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period.\nManagement consider that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/\nor production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year.\nOil and natural gas prices\nThe price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp\u2019s carbon emissions cost\nassumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate\nchange and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 145. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice\npresident economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy\ntransition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon\nsupply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the\nscenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\nDuring the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing were revised. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real\n2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per\nbarrel to reflect near term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy\nsystem decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00\nper mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. These price assumptions are derived\nfrom the central case investment appraisal assumptions (see page 20). A summary of the group\u2019s revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub\ngas, applied in 2024 and 2023, in real 2023 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management\u2019s best estimate of future prices at the\nbalance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line\nwith a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average\ntemperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nHowever, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. Inflation rate of 2% - 2.5% (2023 2%) is applied to determine the price\nassumptions in nominal terms.\n2024 price assumptions\n2025 2030 2040 2050\nBrent oil ($/bbl) 70 70 63 50\nHenry Hub gas ($/mmBtu) 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00\n2023 price assumptions\n2024 2025 2030 2040 2050\nBrent oil ($/bbl) 71 71 71 59 46\nHenry Hub gas ($/mmBtu) 4.06 4.05 4.05 4.05 4.05\nOil and natural gas reserves\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the Company\u2019s estimated oil and\nnatural gas reserves.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions \u2013 continued\nForeign currency translation\nThe functional and presentation currency of the financial statements is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional\ncurrency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are\nretranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the\nincome statement. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\nExchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by a non-US dollar functional currency branch are\ntranslated into US dollars and are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Income statement\ntransactions are translated into US dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period.\nFinancial guarantees\nThe Company enters into financial guarantee contracts with its subsidiaries. The liability for a financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value\nand subsequently measured at the higher of the contract\u2019s estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate,\ncumulative amortization.\nPensions and other post-employment benefits\nThe defined benefit pension plans are plans that share risks between entities under common control. In each instance BP p.l.c. is the principal employer\nand carries the whole plan surplus or deficit on its balance sheet. The cost of providing benefits under the Company\u2019s defined benefit plans is determined\nseparately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service\ncost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan\namendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately\nwhen the company becomes committed to a change.\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-employment benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in\npresent value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the\npresent value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected\nchanges in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts\nincluded in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently\nreclassified to profit and loss.\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of\nthe defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations\nare to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit\npension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions\nto the plan.\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\nSignificant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions involves making significant estimates when measuring the Company's pension plan surpluses and deficits.\nThese estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\nPension assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at\nthe year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the company\u2019s balance sheet, and pension expense for the following year. The\nassumptions used are provided in Note 4.\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these\nvariables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and\nnet assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying\namounts of the company\u2019s pension obligations within the next financial year for the UK plan. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual\noutcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation\nused are provided in Note 4.\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in\nequity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined\nin accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or\ndeductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and\nlaws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and\ntheir carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.", "page_start": 258, "page_end": 259, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not\ndiscounted. See Note 6 for further details.\nIn July 2023, the UK government enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model rules. The legislation is effective for bp from 1 January 2024 and\nincludes an income inclusion rule and a domestic minimum tax, which together are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each\ncountry in which bp operates. Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. In line with the amendments to IAS 12, the\nexception from recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes has been applied.\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through\nprofit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as\nset out below. The Company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have\nbeen transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and\nrewards of the asset have neither been retained nor transferred but control of the asset has been transferred.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash\nflows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective\ninterest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired\nand when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes receivables.\nCash equivalents\nCash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily\nconvertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the\ndate of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value\nthrough profit or loss.\nFinancial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities held by the Company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities include other payables,\naccruals, and amounts payable to subsidiaries. The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost\nAll financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is\ntypically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated\nby taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation\nof liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.", "page_start": 259, "page_end": 260, "company": "BP", "ticker": "BP", "sector": "energy", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-annual-report-and-form-20f-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/BP/2024/BP_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "BP_2024_annual_report"}

As a result, management performed an impairment test of the company's major investments in line with the\nrequirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Management considered the performance of investments and impairment tests performed by the\ncompany\u2019s subsidiaries. Taking into account the decrease in the group\u2019s market capitalisation and an increase in the deficits between the carrying amount\nof the company\u2019s major investments compared with the underlying net assets, compared to 2023, management concluded that an impairment was\nrequired, relating to deterioration of value in use and fair value less cost to sell. An impairment charge of $539 million were recognised against BP Global\nInvestments Limited.

Pensions\nThe defined benefit pension obligation consists primarily of a closed funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the\nmajority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated\ndirectors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is required\nby law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. Employees\nin the UK are eligible for membership of defined contribution plans established with third-party providers.\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.\nFor the primary UK defined benefit plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of\ncontributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2026 formal\nactuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2024.\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK defined benefit plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any\nremaining assets once all members have left the plan.\nThe obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent\nactuarial review was 31 December 2024. The primary UK defined benefit plan is subject to a formal actuarial valuation every 3 years. The most recent\nformal actuarial valuation of the primary UK defined benefit plan was as at 31 December 2023.\nThe material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below. The assumptions are reviewed by\nmanagement at the end of each year and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.\nFinancial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation %\n2024 2023\nDiscount rate for plan liabilities 5.5 4.8\nRate of increase for pensions in payment 2.9 2.8\nRate of increase in deferred pensions 2.9 2.8\nInflation for plan liabilities 3.1 3.0\nFinancial assumptions used to determine benefit expense %\n2024 2023\nDiscount rate for plan other finance expense 4.8 5.0\nThe discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit\npayments. The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. The\ninflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an\nincrease.\nIn addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice\nin the UK and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of\npast longevity improvements into the future. For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows:\nMortality assumptions Years\n2024 2023\nLife expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.0 27.4\nLife expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 28.9 29.2\nLife expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.0 29.2\nLife expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 30.5 30.6\nThe assets of the primary plan are held in a trust, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan. The\nassets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\nA proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In\norder to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios\nare highly diversified.\nThe trustee\u2019s long-term investment objective for the primary UK defined benefit plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same\nway as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI)\napproach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability\nassumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money\nusing existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further\nbonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in\nthe table below.\nFor the primary UK defined benefit plan there is an agreement with the trustee to at least maintain the proportion of assets with liability matching\ncharacteristics and review over time.
