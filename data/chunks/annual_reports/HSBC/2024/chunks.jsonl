For further details of\nour internal scenario analysis, see \u2018Insights from climate scenario analysis\u2019 on page 223.\nRisk type Our approach\nWholesale We have metrics in place to monitor the exposure of our wholesale corporate lending portfolio to six high transition risk sectors, as shown in the\ncredit risk below table. As at 31 December 2024, the overall exposure to the six high transition risk sectors was 18% of total gross carrying amount of\nwholesale loans and advances. These disclosures cover the whole of the value chain of the sector. The sector classifications are based on\ninternal HSBC definitions and can be judgemental in nature. We use publicly available data as well as internal data to determine the appropriate\nsector. The classification of our clients into sectors is performed with inputs from subject matter experts. The sector classifications are subject\nto the remediation of ongoing data quality challenges and continuous improvement of our ongoing processes. The data will continue to be\nenhanced and refined in future years.\nOur relationship managers engage with our key wholesale customers, including those in higher transition risk sectors, through a transition\nengagement questionnaire (\u2018TEQ\u2019). In 2024, the TEQ was expanded to cover all geographies. The TEQ helps to gather information and assess\nour wholesale customers\u2019 business model alignment to a net zero transition and their exposure to physical and transition risks. We use the\nresponses to the questionnaire to risk-assess our key wholesale customers.\nOur credit policies require that relationship managers comment on climate risk factors in credit applications for new money requests and annual\ncredit reviews. Our credit policies also require manual credit risk rating overrides if climate is deemed to have a material impact on credit risk\nunder 12 months if not already captured under the original credit risk rating.\nKey developments to our framework in 2024 included the expansion of the TEQ, as set out above, and additionally the development of climate\nrisk guidelines for relationship managers to further embed climate risk considerations into credit risk assessments.\nKey challenges for further embedding climate risk into credit risk management relate to the availability of adequate physical risk data to assess\nimpacts on our wholesale customers.\nWholesale loan exposure to high transition risk sectors at 31 December 2024\nConstruction,\nContracting & Metals Oil Power\nBuilding and and and Total\nUnits Automotive Chemicals Materials5 mining gas utilities 2024\nWholesale loan exposure as a proportion of\ntotal wholesale loans and advances1,2,3,4 % 4 2 3 2 3 4 18\n1 Percentages shown in the table also include green and other sustainable finance loans, which support the transition to the net zero economy.\nThe methodology for quantifying our exposure to high transition risk sectors and the transition risk metrics will evolve over time as more data\nbecomes available and is incorporated in our risk management systems and processes. We are aiming to develop the appropriate systems,\ndata and processes to provide enhanced disclosures in future years.\n2 Counterparties are allocated to the high transition risk sectors via a two-step approach. Firstly, where the main business of a group of\nconnected counterparties is in a high transition risk sector, all lending to the group is included in one high transition risk sector irrespective of\nthe sector of each individual obligor within the group. Secondly, where the main business of a group of connected counterparties is not in a\nhigh transition risk sector, only lending to individual obligors in the high transition risk sectors is included. The main business of a group of\nconnected counterparties is identified by the industry that generates the majority of revenue within a group. Customer revenue data utilised\nduring this allocation process is the most recent readily available and will not always align to our own reporting period.\n3 The six high transition risk sectors make up 18% of total gross carrying amount of wholesale loans and advances to banks and customers of\n$596bn. Amounts include assets held for sale.\n4 The sectors used to monitor the wholesale corporate lending portfolio set out in the table are different to the scope of sectors we focus on for\nfinanced emissions targets and reporting. The latter focus on the most carbon-emissive sectors, and the parts of the value chain where we\nbelieve the majority of emissions are produced to help reduce double counting. These sectors are set out within 'Financed emissions' section\non page 48.\n5 Construction, Contracting & Building Materials has been renamed from Construction & Building Materials. The name has been revised to\nclarify that parties who build assets for end clients, investors and landowners, which should be included in this sector for their associated\nconstruction risks.\nRetail credit Climate risk may impact retail credit risk through an increase in credit losses on our global retail mortgage portfolio, primarily due to the impact of\nrisk physical risk. Our current climate assessment, in line with last year\u2019s assessment, indicates that our retail mortgage portfolio remains resilient to\nclimate risk, with impact severity muted at a portfolio level given that our book has diversified property locations, with insurance coverage being\na key loan covenant. Our retail credit risk mortgage policy requires that every mortgage market conducts an annual review of their climate risk\nmanagement framework, to ensure they remain fit for purpose. Within our mortgage portfolios, properties or areas with potentially heightened\nphysical risk are identified and assessed locally with exposure monitored using risk indicators. A reduction in property value, higher insurance\ncosts and insurance availability are potential future negative financial impacts for properties with higher physical risk.\nUK retail mortgage book\nThe UK is our largest mortgage market, and as of November 2024, made up 46.7% of our global mortgage portfolio. Our ESG Data Pack\nincludes our climate risk exposures for this portfolio across regions. The maturity profile of the UK mortgage book shows that the average\nremaining contractual term in the UK is 21.8 years. However, with some customers undertaking refinancing options during this term, the\naverage term of the mortgage can be reduced to between five and eight years. This means our strategic approach to climate risk considers both\npresent day risk and long-term forward-looking risk, given that customers may choose to remain with us over the lifespan of the loan. Please see\nthe result of our climate scenario analysis on page 226.\nPhysical risk\nFor the UK mortgage book, flood data is sourced from a third-party data provider, and considers the UK only, covering present day risk from tidal,\nriver and surface water/flash flooding baselined to 2021. A flood risk rating score of 0-100 is provided with 100 being highest risk. Flood risk\nscores are based on the average annual loss generated using flood hazard frequency, flood depths and based on the probability of flooding\nevents occurring. For the UK mortgage book, flood data is available for 93.7% of the mortgage book of which 0.9% is at a very high risk of\nflooding, with 2.7% of the book at a high risk of flooding. Geographically, by lending balances, our highest risk exposures are the Greater London\nand South-East regions. During 2024 we changed our flood risk classification of very high risk to align to the provider\u2019s flood score bands. The\npostcode data used in the regional flood table has also been refined to incorporate a more granular approach. This has helped to aid the regional\nallocation and as a result the 2023 data has been restated to reflect this.\nRisk\nreview", "page_start": 222, "page_end": 223, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

We track EPC ratings\nfor both owner occupied (\u2018OO\u2019) and buy to let (\u2018BTL\u2019), which are 96.6% of the portfolio and 3.4% of the portfolio by lending value, respectively.\nThe EPC profile is broadly improving (to higher bands) but is evolving slowly, and the pace is dependent on regulation. Where we do not hold a\ncurrent EPC, we have included expired EPCs for 2024.

Despite this, our strategic approach to climate risk considers present day and long-term risk given customers may remain on\nour book for the whole loan term.\nFor further details of flood risk and the EPC breakdown of our UK retail mortgage portfolio, see our ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.\n1 The table includes instances where individual properties have multiple associated accounts and mortgage balances.

As part of our Internal Climate Scenario Analysis\n(\u2018ICSA\u2019), we have developed an exploratory scenario to understand the impact of a potential greenwashing event on our deposits. For further\ndetails, please see page 224.\nIn October 2024 we published our Green Financing Framework, in alignment with the International Capital Market Association Green Bond\nPrinciples. This framework promotes transparency, forming part of our sustainability strategy and helping to further our aim of supporting our\nclients in transitioning to a net zero future.\nPension risk\nClimate risk could result in additional costs within our defined benefit pension plans, due to changes in the pension plans\u2019 investment\nperformance or through having to meet evolving regulatory requirements.\nOur global policies on the oversight of pension investments explicitly reflect climate considerations. Training has been provided to local\nmanagement on how to consider ESG risks in pension investments. We also conduct an annual exercise to estimate the exposure of our largest\npension plans to climate risk.\nInsurance risk\nClimate risk could result in losses on our insurance assets due to changes in macroeconomic parameters.\nWe develop an annual plan to support the management of climate risk.

Executive Directors\nreceive an overall performance assessment that considers performance against goals and role expectations, and demonstration of our values-\naligned behaviours. This is considered by the Committee when applying discretion to the formulaic scorecard outcomes.\nElements Details\nAnnual incentive To drive and reward performance against annual financial and non-financial objectives that are consistent with the strategy and align\nto shareholder interests.\nOperation Annual incentive awards are discretionary and can be delivered in any combination of cash and shares under the HSBC Share Plan\n2011 (\u2018HSBC Share Plan\u2019). Shares will not normally represent less than 50% of any award and are normally immediately vested.\nOn vesting, shares equivalent to the net number of shares that vested (after those sold to cover any income tax and social security\npayable) must be held for a retention period up to one year, or such other period as may be expected by regulators.\nThe awards will be subject to clawback (i.e. repayment or recoupment of paid/vested awards) on or after vesting for a period of seven\nyears from the date of award, or such other period as required by regulators. This may be extended to 10 years, or such other period\nas required by regulators in the event of an ongoing internal/regulatory investigation at the end of the seven-year period. Details of the\nclawback provision are set out in the bottom section of this table.\nAny deferred shares may be entitled to dividend equivalents during the vesting period, which will be paid on vesting. Where awards\ndo not receive dividend equivalents during the vesting period (to meet regulatory requirements), the number of shares to be awarded\nwill be determined using a fair value share price (defined in accordance with relevant accounting standards) discounted for the\nexpected dividend yield.\nAny deferred cash award may be entitled to notional returns during the deferral period, or any appropriate adjustment to reflect such\nnotional returns, as determined by the Committee.\nThe Committee retains discretion to:\n\u2013 apply a longer retention period;\n\u2013 increase the proportion of the award to be delivered in shares; or\n\u2013 defer the vesting of a portion of the awards, subject to such conditions that the Committee may determine at its discretion (which\nmay include continued employment). The deferred awards will be subject to malus (i.e. reduction and/or cancellation of unvested\nawards) provisions during any applicable deferral period.\nThe Committee also retains discretion to amend the structure and terms of awards to reflect changes in regulatory requirements\nwhilst ensuring that any changes will align with the key principles of the Directors' remuneration policy.\nThe Committee may adjust and amend awards in accordance with the relevant plan rules.\nMaximum opportunity The maximum opportunity for the annual incentive award in respect of a financial year is up to 300% of base salary.\nPerformance measures Performance is normally measured against an annual scorecard, based on targets set for financial and non-financial measures,\ndetermined at the beginning of the financial year. The scorecards may vary by individual.\nMeasures with financial targets will generally have a weighting of 60% for both the Group CEO and the Group CFO. The Committee\nwill review the scorecard annually and may vary the measures, weighting and targets each year.\nThe overall payout of the annual incentive could be between 0% (for below minimum performance) and 100% of the maximum\nopportunity.\nMinimum and maximum performance levels for each measure are defined in the scorecard. 25% of the award opportunity will pay\nout for achieving minimum performance and 100% of the award will pay out for achieving maximum performance. Details on payout\nbetween these levels will be disclosed in the respective Directors' Remuneration Report.\nThe Committee exercises its judgement to determine performance achieved and awards at the end of the performance period, which\nin normal circumstances will be one financial year, to ensure that the outcome is fair in the context of overall Group and individual\nperformance.

The awards are granted as rights to receive shares under the HSBC Share Plan, normally subject to a forward-looking three-year\nperformance period from the start of the financial year in which the awards are granted.\nAt the end of the performance period, the performance outcome will be used to assess the percentage of the awards that will vest.\nThese shares will then normally vest in five equal instalments, with the first vesting on or around the third anniversary of the grant\ndate and the last instalment vesting on or around the seventh anniversary of the grant date, in accordance with current UK\nremuneration rules.\nOn each vesting, shares equivalent to the net number of shares that vested (after those sold to cover any income tax and social\nsecurity payable) must be held for a retention period up to one year (or such other period as may be permitted by regulators).\nAwards are subject to malus provisions prior to vesting. The awards will also be subject to clawback on or after vesting for a period of\nseven years from the date of award, or such other period as required by regulators. This may be extended to 10 years, or such other\nperiod as required by regulators, in the event of an ongoing internal/regulatory investigation at the end of the seven-year period.\nDetails of the malus and clawback provisions are set out in the previous section on annual incentive awards.\nAwards may be entitled to dividend equivalents during the vesting period, which will be paid on vesting. Where awards do not receive\ndividend equivalents during the vesting period (to meet regulatory requirements), the number of shares to be awarded will be\ndetermined using a fair value share price discounted for the expected dividend yield.\nThe Committee also retains discretion to amend the structure and terms of awards to reflect changes in regulatory requirements\nwhilst ensuring that any changes will align with the key principles of the Directors' remuneration policy. In any event, we expect the\nweighted average time horizon of the deferral period to be at least five years.\nThe Committee may adjust or amend awards in accordance with the rules of the HSBC Share Plan.\nMaximum opportunity The maximum opportunity for the LTI award in respect of a financial year is up to 600% of base salary.\nPerformance measures The Committee will take into consideration prior performance when assessing the value of the LTI grant. Forward-looking\nperformance is measured against a long-term scorecard, determined at the start of the financial year in which awards are granted.\nFinancial measures will generally have a weighting of 60% or more.\nFor each measure, the Committee will determine the extent of achievement based on actual performance against the target set and\nother relevant factors that the Committee considers appropriate to take account of in order to better reflect the Group's underlying\nperformance. The overall payout level could be between 0% (for below minimum performance) and 100% of the maximum.\nMinimum, target and maximum performance levels for each measure are defined in the scorecard. 25% of the award opportunity will\nvest for achieving minimum performance, 50% of the award will vest for achieving target performance and 100% of the award will\nvest for achieving maximum performance. Where performance achieved is between the minimum, target and maximum level of\nperformance set in the scorecard, the number of awards that will vest will be determined on a straight-line basis.\nThe Committee can adjust the LTI payout based on the outcome of the performance measures, if it considers that the payout\ndetermined does not appropriately reflect the overall position and performance of the Group during the performance period.\nThe scorecard outcome may also be subject to a risk and compliance modifier and/or a capital underpin under which the Committee\nwill have the discretion to adjust down the overall scorecard outcome, taking into account performance against those factors.\nPerformance targets will normally be set annually for each three-year cycle. The Committee has the discretion to:\n\u2013 change the overall weighting of the financial and non-financial measures, whilst ensuring the overall balance remains appropriate;\n\u2013 vary the measures and their respective weightings within each category. The specific performance measures will be disclosed in\n\u2013 vary the risk and compliance and/or any underpin measures; and\n\u2013 make adjustments to performance targets, measures, weightings and/or outcomes in exceptional circumstances. This may be to\nreflect significant one-off items that occur during the measurement period and/or where the Committee determines that original\nmeasures, targets or conditions are no longer appropriate or that an amendment is required so that the measures, targets or\nconditions achieve their original purpose.

In exercising this discretion, the Committee will take into account the circumstances in which the\nindividual is appointed (for example, if it is promotion of an internal candidate or an external appointment), expectations of\nshareholders and any regulatory requirements.\nTotal variable pay awarded for the year in which the individual is newly appointed as an executive Director will be limited to\n900% of base salary.

Other than as set out in the table, there are no further\nobligations that could give rise to remuneration payments or payments for loss of office:\nPayments for loss of office\nComponent of remuneration Approach taken\nFixed pay and benefits Executive Directors may be entitled to payments in lieu of:\n\u2013 notice, which may consist of base salary, cash in lieu of pension allowance, and other contractual benefits, or an amount in\nlieu of; and/or\n\u2013 accrued but untaken holiday entitlement.\nPayments may be made in instalments or a lump sum, and may be subject to mitigation, and subject to applicable tax and\nsocial security deductions.\nAnnual incentive and LTI In exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Committee, an executive Director may be eligible for the grant of annual\nincentives and/or LTIs under the HSBC Share Plan, taking into account the time worked in the performance year and based\non the individual\u2019s contribution.\nUnvested awards All unvested awards will be forfeited when an executive Director ceases employment voluntarily and is not deemed a good\nleaver. An executive Director may be considered a good leaver, under the HSBC Share Plan, if their employment ceases in\nspecified circumstances, which include:\n\u2013 ill health, injury or disability, as established to the satisfaction of the Committee;\n\u2013 retirement with the agreement and approval of the Committee;\n\u2013 the employee\u2019s employer ceasing to be a member of the Group;\n\u2013 redundancy with the agreement and approval of the Committee; or\n\u2013 any other reason at the discretion of the Committee.\nIf an executive Director is considered a good leaver, unvested awards will normally continue to vest in line with the applicable\nvesting dates, subject to performance conditions, the HSBC share plan rules, and malus and clawback provisions. Unless the\nCommittee determined otherwise, awards made subject to forward-looking performance conditions, including LTI awards,\nwill normally be subject to pro-rating for time in employment during the performance period.\nIn the event of death, unvested awards will vest and be released to the executive Director\u2019s estate as soon as practicable.\nIn respect of outstanding unvested awards, the Committee may determine that good leaver status is contingent upon the\nCommittee being satisfied that the executive Director has no current or future intention at the date of leaving HSBC of being\nemployed by any competitor financial services firm. The Committee determines the list of competitor firms from time to\ntime, and the length of time for which this restriction applies. If the Committee becomes aware of any evidence to the\ncontrary before vesting, the award will lapse.\nPost-departure benefits Executive Directors can be provided certain benefits for up to a maximum of seven years from date of departure for those\nwho depart under good leaver provisions under the HSBC Share Plan, in accordance with the terms of the policy. Benefits\nmay include, but are not limited to, medical coverage, tax return preparation assistance and legal expenses.\nOther Where an executive Director has been relocated as part of their employment, the Committee retains the discretion to pay the\nrepatriation costs. This may include, but is not restricted to, airfare, accommodation, shipment, storage, utilities, and any tax\nand social security that may be due in respect of such benefits.\nExcept in the case of gross misconduct or resignation, an executive Director may also receive retirement gifts.\nLegal claims The Committee retains the discretion to make payments (including professional and outplacement fees) in connection with\nan executive Director\u2019s cessation of office or employment. This may include payments that are made in good faith in\ndischarge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement of\nany claim arising in connection with the cessation of that executive Director\u2019s office or employment.\nChange of control In the event of a change of control, outstanding awards will be treated in line with the provisions set out in the respective\nplan rules.\nOther directorships Service contracts\nExecutive Directors may accept appointments as non-executive The service contracts of executive Directors do not have a fixed term.\nDirectors of companies that are not part of HSBC if so authorised by The notice periods of executive Directors are set at the discretion of\neither the Board or the Nomination & Corporate Governance the Committee, taking into account market practice and governance\nCommittee. considerations.\nWhen considering a request to accept a non-executive Director Service agreements for each executive Director are available for\nappointment, the Board or the Nomination & Corporate Governance inspection at HSBC Holdings\u2019 registered office.

For the purpose of the Pillar 3 remuneration disclosures, executive Directors and non-\nexecutive Directors are considered to be members of the management body. Members of the Group Executive Committee other than the\nexecutive Directors are considered as senior management.\nLink between risk, performance and reward\nOur remuneration practices promote sound and effective risk management to support our business objectives and the delivery of our strategy.\nWe set out below the key features of our framework, which enable us to align between risk, performance and reward, subject to compliance\nwith local laws and regulations:\nFramework\nelements Application\nVariable pay \u2013 Group variable pay is expected to reflect Group performance, based on a range of financial and non-financial factors. We use a structured\npayout ratio range, that varies the payout ratio with profits before tax, and a countercyclical funding methodology, with both a floor and a\nceiling, with the payout ratio generally reducing as performance increases to avoid pro-cyclicality. The floor recognises that even in challenging\ntimes, remaining competitive is important. The ceiling recognises that at higher levels of performance it is not always necessary to continue to\nincrease variable pay, thereby limiting the risk of inappropriate behaviour to drive financial performance.\n\u2013 The main quantitative and qualitative performance and risk metrics used for assessment of performance include:\n\u2013 Group and business unit financial performance, considering contextual factors driving performance, and capital requirements;\n\u2013 current and future risks, taking into consideration performance against the risk appetite, financial resourcing plan and global conduct\noutcomes; and\n\u2013 fines, penalties and provisions for customer redress, which are automatically included in the Committee\u2019s definition of profit for\ndetermining the pool.\n\u2013 In the event that the Group was unable to distribute dividends to shareholders for reasons such as capital adequacy, then the Group may\ndetermine that as a year of weak performance. In such a year, the Group may withhold some, or all, variable pay for employees including\nunvested share awards, using the metrics outlined above as a basis for that determination.\nIndividual \u2013 Assessment of individual performance is made with reference to clear and relevant financial and non-financial goals. Goals for senior\nperformance management take into account appropriate measures linked to sustainability risks, such as: reduction in carbon footprint; facilitating financing\nto help clients with their transition to net zero; employee inclusion; and risk and compliance measures, subject to local legal requirements.\n\u2013 A mandatory global risk and compliance goal is included for all other employees. Subject to any legal/regulatory requirements, all employees\nreceive an overall performance assessment supported by an assessment against the minimum values-aligned behaviours and conduct\nstandards expected of all colleagues and performance on their goals. This ensures that performance is assessed not only on what is achieved\nbut also on how it is achieved.\nControl \u2013 Group policy is for control functions staff to report into their respective function. Remuneration decisions for senior functional roles are made\nfunction staff by the global function head.\n\u2013 The performance and reward of individuals in control functions, including risk and compliance colleagues, are assessed according to a balanced\nscorecard of goals specific to the functional role they undertake.\n\u2013 Their remuneration is determined independent of the performance of the business areas they oversee.\n\u2013 Remuneration is carefully benchmarked with the market and internally to ensure it is set at an appropriate level.\n\u2013 The Committee is responsible for approving remuneration for the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and Group Head of Internal Audit.\nVariable pay \u2013 Variable pay awards may be adjusted upwards or downwards to reflect positive or negative conduct in adherence with the Code of Conduct.\nadjustments Downward adjustments can be made in circumstances including:\nand conduct \u2013 detrimental conduct, including conduct that brings HSBC into disrepute;\nrecognition \u2013 involvement in events resulting in significant operational losses, or events that have caused or have the potential to cause significant harm\nto HSBC; and\n\u2013 non-compliance with the values-aligned behaviours and other mandatory requirements or policies.\n\u2013 Rewarding positive conduct can be through use of our global recognition platform, At Our Best, or positive adjustments to variable pay awards.\nMalus \u2013 Malus can be applied to unvested deferred awards (up to 100% of awards) granted in prior years in circumstances including:\n\u2013 detrimental conduct, including conduct that brings the business into disrepute;\n\u2013 past performance being materially worse than originally reported;\n\u2013 restatement, correction or amendment of any financial statements; and\n\u2013 improper or inadequate risk management.\nClawback \u2013 Clawback can be applied to vested or paid awards granted to MRTs on or after 1 January 2015 (and awards granted to non-MRTs on or after\n1 January 2022) for a period of seven years, extended to 10 years for employees in PRA and FCA designated senior management functions in\nthe event of ongoing internal/regulatory investigation at the end of the seven-year period. Clawback may be applied in circumstances including:\n\u2013 participation in, or responsibility for, conduct that results in significant losses;\n\u2013 failing to meet appropriate standards and propriety;\n\u2013 reasonable evidence of misconduct or material error that would justify, or would have justified, summary termination of a contract of\nemployment; and\n\u2013 a material failure of risk management suffered by HSBC or a business unit in the context of Group risk-management standards, policies and\nprocedures.\n\u2013 Clawback can also be applied to vested or paid awards granted to designated Executive Officers as defined by the US Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u2019SEC\u2019) for a period of three years in the event of an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with any financial\nreporting requirement under the US securities laws.\nSales \u2013 We generally do not operate commission-based sales plans, unless aligned with local market practice and with appropriate safeguards to avoid\nincentives incentivising inappropriate sales behaviours.\nIdentification \u2013 We identify individuals as MRTs based on qualitative and quantitative criteria set out in the PRA\u2019s and FCA\u2019s remuneration rules. Our\nof MRTs identification process is underpinned by the following key principles:\n\u2013 MRTs are identified at Group, HSBC Bank (consolidated) and HSBC UK Bank level.\n\u2013 MRTs are also identified at other solo regulated entity level as required by the regulations.\n\u2013 When identifying an MRT, HSBC considers a colleague\u2019s role within its matrix management structure. The global business and function that\nan individual works within takes precedence, followed by the geographical location in which they work.\n\u2013 We also identify additional MRTs based on our own internal criteria, which include compensation thresholds and individuals in certain roles and\ngrades who otherwise would not be identified as MRTs under the remuneration rules.", "page_start": 304, "page_end": 306, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

Individual tax liabilities were satisfied in cash, therefore the face value awarded represents the net of tax\nvalue of the shares and the number of shares awarded reflects the net of tax number of shares.

In performing our risk\nassessment we engaged with a number of stakeholders to ensure we appropriately understood and considered these risks and their\ninterrelationships. This included stakeholders within HSBC and our own experts within PwC. This engagement covered external factors across\nthe geopolitical, macroeconomic, regulatory and accounting landscape, and the impact of climate risk. It also covered the strategy and\ntransformation-driven internal environment at HSBC, with particular attention to the announced Group reorganisation. The impact of this\nreorganisation on financial reporting will primarily be in later reporting periods.\nScoping\nThe risks of material misstatement can be reduced to an acceptable level by testing the entities that are significant due to their size and those\nthat drive particular significant risks identified as part of our risk assessment. We continually assessed risks and changed the scope of our audit\nwhere necessary. Our risk assessment and scoping identified certain entities (collectively the 'Significant Components') for which we obtained\naudit opinions.\nAudit opinions\nFull scope over specific\naudit opinion balances\nHSBC Holdings plc* u\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited** u\nHSBC Bank plc** u\nHSBC UK Bank plc* u\nHSBC North America Holdings Inc** u\nHSBC Mexico S.A.* u\n* Opinion for the company financial position and performance.\n** Opinion for the consolidated financial position and performance.\nWe instructed other PwC network firms to perform the audits of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC North\nAmerica Holdings Inc and HSBC Mexico S.A.. The audits for HSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK Bank plc were performed by PwC teams in the UK,\nwho themselves then instructed other PwC network firms to perform work in certain areas.\nWe also performed audit work over centralised functions supporting specific balances in other components. These components are HSBC Global\nServices (UK) Limited, HSBC Group Management Services Limited, and HSBC Global Services (HK) Limited. This work was performed by PwC teams\nin the UK.\nSignificant Components audit approach\nWe instructed the component auditors reporting to us on the Significant Components to work to assigned materiality levels reflecting the size\nof the operations they audited. Certain Significant Component auditors performed their work to a local statutory audit materiality that was a\nlower level than our allocated Group materiality.\nWe designed global audit approaches for the products and services that substantially make up HSBC's global businesses, such as lending,\ndeposits and derivatives. These approaches were provided to the engagement partners and teams performing audit testing for the Significant\nComponents.\nWe were in active dialogue throughout the year with the component auditors of the Significant Components, including directing how they\nplanned and performed their work. Senior members of our team undertook at least one in-person site visit where a full scope audit was\nrequested and we had oversight over certain areas of audit work performed. We attended Audit Committee meetings for some of the\nSignificant Components. We also attended meetings with management for each of these Significant Components at the year end.\nIn planning and executing our oversight plan, we considered where reliance was placed on PwC network firms to perform a full scope audit.\nGiven the relative financial significance of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited to the Group, we concluded this\ncomponent required a full scope audit. As a result, we placed specific focus on the direction, supervision and review of the work performed by\nour teams in Hong Kong and China. The frequency of dialogue with these teams was substantial throughout all stages of our audit, we also;\nperformed additional site visits with component auditors and management, held workshops in several areas where their work supported the\nGroup audit and increased the nature and extent of review over the audit work performed by these teams.\nOverall coverage Net operating income Total assets\nThe components where\nwe performed audit procedures\ncovered approximately:\n72% 82%\nFinancial\nstatements", "page_start": 336, "page_end": 337, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

A significant amount of IT and\noperational processes and controls relevant to financial reporting are undertaken in operations centres run by Digital Business Services ('DBS').\nWhilst these operations centres are not separate components, the IT and operational processes and controls are relevant to the financial\ninformation of the Components. Financial reporting processes and controls are also performed centrally in HSBC's Group Finance function and\nfinance operation centres ('Finance Operations'), including the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets, held for sale\nclassifications and the consolidation of the Group's results, the preparation of financial statements, and management's oversight controls\nrelevant to the Group's financial reporting.\nGroup-wide processes or processes in DBS and Finance Operations are subject to specified audit procedures or an audit over specific financial\nstatement line items. For these areas, we either performed audit work ourselves, or directed and provided oversight of the audit work\nperformed by PwC teams in the UK, Poland, China, Malaysia, India, France, Hong Kong and the Philippines. This audit work, together with\nanalytical review procedures and assessing the outcome of local external audits, also addressed the risk of material misstatement for balances\nin entities that were not part of a Significant Component.\nMateriality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together\nwith qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the\nindividual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the\nfinancial statements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nGroup Parent Company\nOverall materiality $1.5bn $1.4bn\n(FY23 $1.6bn) (FY23 $1.5bn)\nHow we 5% 0.75%\ndetermined it\nof profit before tax adjusted for notable items of total assets then capped to 95% of the group materiality.\nRationale for We believe a benchmark based on 5% of profit before tax A benchmark of total assets has been used, as the parent\nbenchmark applied excluding notable items is an appropriate quantitative indicator of company's primary purpose is to act as a holding parent company\nmateriality, although certain items could also be material for with investments in the Group's subsidiaries, not to generate\nqualitative reasons.

The\nrange of materiality allocated across components was between $0.1bn and $1.4bn.\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected\nmisstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature\nand extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes.\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors \u2013 the history of misstatements, risk assessment and\naggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls \u2013 and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.", "page_start": 337, "page_end": 338, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities,\noutlined below, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of\ndetecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations\nrelated to breaches of financial crime laws and regulations and regulatory compliance, including regulatory reporting requirements and conduct\nof business, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also\nconsidered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and relevant tax\nlegislation. We evaluated management\u2019s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk\nof override of controls) and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries in relation to cost targets,\nand management bias in accounting estimates, particularly those related to the valuation of certain financial instruments. The Group\nengagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in\nresponse to such risks in their work.\nAudit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\nReview of correspondence with and reports from regulators, including the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and Financial\nConduct Authority ('FCA').\nReview of reporting to the GAC and the Group Risk Committee in respect of compliance and legal matters.\nEnquiry of management and those charged with governance, and review of internal audit reports insofar as they related to the\nfinancial statements.\nObtaining legal confirmations from legal advisors relating to material litigation and compliance matters.\nAssessing matters reported on the Group's whistleblowing programmes and the results of management's investigation of such\nmatters, insofar as they related to the financial statements.\nChallenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to\nthe determination of the valuation of certain financial instruments, ECL, and the impairment assessment of investment in\nsubsidiaries.\nObtaining confirmations from third parties to confirm the existence of a sample of transactions and balances.\nIdentifying and testing journal entries, including those posted with certain descriptions, posted to certain account combinations, or\nposted by unexpected users.\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with\nlaws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting\na material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate\nconcealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques.\nHowever, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations.

The balance of $1,669m was charged against retained earnings.\n2 Statutory share premium relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 was taken in respect of the acquisition of HSBC Bank plc in 1992,\nHSBC Continental Europe in 2000 and HSBC Finance Corporation in 2003, and the shares issued were recorded at their nominal value only. In HSBC\u2019s\nconsolidated financial statements, the fair value differences of $8,290m in respect of HSBC Continental Europe and $12,768m in respect of HSBC Finance\nCorporation were recognised in the merger reserve. The merger reserve created on the acquisition of HSBC Finance Corporation subsequently became\nattached to HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited, following a number of intra-Group reorganisations, and has since been transferred to retained earnings as\npart of the impairment recognised in respect of HSBC Overseas Holding (UK) Limited. During 2009, pursuant to section 131 of the Companies Act 1985,\nstatutory share premium relief was taken in respect of the rights issue and $15,796m was recognised in the merger reserve.\n3 The insurance finance reserve reflects the impact of the adoption of the other comprehensive income option for our insurance business in France. Underlying\nassets supporting these contracts are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Under this option, only the amount that matches income or\nexpenses recognised in profit or loss on underlying items is included in finance income or expenses, resulting in the elimination of income statement accounting\nmismatches. The remaining amount of finance income or expenses for these insurance contracts is recognised in other comprehensive income (\u2018OCI\u2019).\n4 At 31 December 2024, retained earnings included 28,744,609 own shares held. These include own shares held within HSBC\u2019s insurance business\u2019s retirement\nfunds for the benefit of policyholders or beneficiaries within employee trusts for the settlement of shares expected to be delivered under employee share\nschemes or bonus plans, and the market-making activities in Markets and Securities Services.\n5 At 31 December 2024, accumulated foreign currency translation reserve losses of $5,816m were recycled to the income statement, including $5,166m upon\ncompletion of the sale of our business in Argentina and $564m upon completion of the sale of our banking business in Canada.\n6 HSBC Holdings issued SGD1,500m 5.250% contingent convertible securities in June 2024, and a further $1,350m 6.875% and $1,150m 6.950% contingent\nconvertible securities in September 2024. All instruments were recorded net of issuance costs.\n7 In September 2024, HSBC Holdings redeemed its $2,250m 6.375% contingent convertible securities.\n8 At 31 December 2024, an impairment of $11,442m (2023: $5,512m) of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited was recognised, resulting in a permitted transfer\nof $2,945m (2023: $5,130m) from the remaining historical merger reserve to retained earnings, and a realisation of nil share-based payment reserve (2023:\n$382m) within retained earnings. In 2022, a part-reversal of the impairment resulted in a transfer from retained earnings back to the merger reserve of $2,499m.\n9 HSBC Holdings announced the following share buy-backs during the year: a share buy-back of up to $2.0bn in February 2024, which was completed in April\n2024; a share buy-back of up to $3.0bn in April 2024, which was completed in July 2024; a share buy-back of up to $3.0bn in July 2024, which was completed in\nOctober 2024; and a share buy-back of up to $3.0bn in October 2024, which was completed in February 2025.", "page_start": 347, "page_end": 348, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

Accounting\npolicies have been applied consistently.\n(b) Differences between IFRS Accounting Standards and Hong Kong Financial Reporting\nStandards\nThere are no significant differences between IFRS Accounting Standards and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards in terms of their\napplication to HSBC, and consequently there would be no significant differences had the financial statements been prepared in accordance\nwith Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The \u2018Notes on the financial statements\u2019, taken together with the \u2018Report of the Directors\u2019,\ninclude the aggregate of all disclosures necessary to satisfy IFRS Accounting Standards and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.\n(c) Future accounting developments\nMinor amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (\u2018IASB\u2019) has published a number of minor amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards that are\neffective from 1 January 2025. HSBC expects they will have an insignificant effect, when adopted, on the consolidated financial statements of\nHSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings.\nOther amendments and new IFRS Accounting Standards\nAmendments to IFRS 9 \u2018Financial Instruments\u2019 and IFRS 7 \u2018Financial Instruments: Disclosures\u2019\nIn May 2024, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9 \u2018Financial Instruments\u2019 and IFRS 7 \u2018Financial Instruments: Disclosures\u2019, effective for\nsettled when using an electronic payment system, the amendments also provide further clarification regarding the classification of financial\nassets that contain contractual terms that change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows, including those arising from ESG-related\ncontingencies, and financial assets with certain non-recourse features.

The Group is undertaking an assessment of the potential impact.\nFinancial\nstatements\nNotes on the financial statements\nIFRS 18 \u2018Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\u2019\non or after 1 January 2027. The new accounting standard aims to give users of financial statements more transparent and comparable\ninformation about an entity\u2019s financial performance. It will replace IAS 1 \u2018Presentation of Financial Statements\u2019 but carries over many\nrequirements from that IFRS Accounting Standard unchanged. In addition, there are three sets of new requirements relating to the structure of\nthe income statement, management-defined performance measures and the aggregation and disaggregation of financial information.\nWhile IFRS 18 will not change recognition criteria or measurement bases, it may have an impact on presenting information in the financial\nstatements, in particular the income statement and to a lesser extent the cash flow statement. HSBC are currently assessing impacts and data\nreadiness before developing a more detailed implementation plan.\n(d) Foreign currencies\nHSBC\u2019s consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major currency\nbloc in which HSBC transacts and funds its business. The US dollar is also HSBC Holdings\u2019 functional currency because the US dollar and\ncurrencies linked to it are the most significant currencies relevant to the underlying transactions, events and conditions of its subsidiaries, as\nwell as representing a significant proportion of its funds generated from financing activities.\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in\nforeign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, except non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at\nhistorical cost, which are translated using the rate of exchange at the initial transaction date. Exchange differences are included in other\ncomprehensive income or in the income statement depending on where the gain or loss on the underlying item is recognised. Except for\nsubsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies, in the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of branches,\nsubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional currency is not US dollars are translated into the Group\u2019s presentation currency at\nthe rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, while their results are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the\nreporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, exchange\ndifferences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.\n(e) Presentation of information\nAccounts 2024 as follows:\n\u2013 Disclosures concerning the nature and extent of risks relating to insurance contracts and financial instruments are included in the \u2018Risk\nreview\u2019 on pages 126 to 235.\n\u2013 The \u2018Own funds disclosure\u2019 is included in the \u2018Risk review\u2019 on page 205.\nHSBC follows the UK Finance Disclosure Code. The UK Finance Disclosure Code aims to increase the quality and comparability of UK banks\u2019\ndisclosures and sets out five disclosure principles together with supporting guidance agreed in 2010. In line with the principles of the UK\nFinance Disclosure Code, HSBC assesses good practice recommendations issued from time to time by relevant regulators and standard\nsetters, and will assess the applicability and relevance of such guidance, enhancing disclosures where appropriate.\n(f) Critical estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and judgements about future conditions. In view of the inherent\nuncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the recognition or measurement of items, highlighted as the \u2018critical estimates and\njudgements\u2019 in section 1.2 below, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from those on which management\u2019s\nestimates are based. This could result in materially different estimates and judgements from those reached by management for the purposes\nof these financial statements. Management\u2019s selection of HSBC\u2019s accounting policies that contain critical estimates and judgements reflects\nthe materiality of the items to which the policies are applied and the high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty involved.\nManagement has considered the impact of climate-related risks on HSBC\u2019s financial position and performance. While the effects of climate\nchange are a source of uncertainty, as at 31 December 2024 management did not consider there to be a material impact on our critical\njudgements and estimates from the physical, transition and other climate-related risks in the short to medium term. In particular, management\nhas considered the known and observable potential impacts of climate-related risks of associated judgements and estimates in our value in use\ncalculations.\n(g) Going concern\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors are satisfied that the Group and parent company have the\nresources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range of\ninformation relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, liquidity, capital requirements and capital\nresources.\nThese considerations include stressed scenarios that reflect the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment following uncertain inflation,\nrapidly changing interest rates, slower Chinese economic activity, and disrupted supply chains as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, conflict in\nthe Middle East and US-China tensions. They also included other top and emerging risks, including climate change, as well as the related\nimpacts on profitability, capital and liquidity.\n1.2Summary of material accounting policies\n(a) Consolidation and related policies\nInvestments in subsidiaries\nWhere an entity is governed by voting rights, HSBC consolidates when it holds \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 the necessary voting rights to pass\nresolutions by the governing body.

The Group\u2019s consideration of this risk includes taking account of the\npotential implications for CGUs arising from the revised organisational structure effective from 1 January 2025.\nHSBC sponsored structured entities\nHSBC is considered to sponsor another entity if, in addition to ongoing involvement with the entity, it had a key role in establishing that entity or\nin bringing together relevant counterparties so the transaction that is the purpose of the entity could occur.

Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are\nrecognised using the equity method. The attributable share of the results and reserves of joint ventures and associates is included in the\nconsolidated financial statements of HSBC based on either financial statements made up to 31 December or pro-rated amounts adjusted for\nany material transactions or events occurring between the date the financial statements are available and 31 December.\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication that the\ninvestment may be impaired, by comparing the recoverable amount of the relevant investment to its carrying amount. Goodwill on acquisition\nof interests in joint ventures and associates is not tested separately for impairment, but is assessed as part of the carrying amount of the\ninvestment. Previously recognised impairments are assessed for reversal when there are indicators that they may no longer exist or have\ndecreased. Any reversal, which may arise only from changes in estimates used to determine the prior impairment loss, is recognised to the\nextent that it does not increase the carrying amount above that had no impairment loss been previously recognised.\nCritical estimates and judgements\nThe most significant critical estimates relate to the assessment of impairment or its reversal of our investment in Bank of Communications Co., Limited (\u2018BoCom\u2019),\nwhich involves estimations of value in use:\nJudgements Estimates\n\u2013 The value in use calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders\nprepared in accordance with IAS 36 \u2018Impairment of Assets\u2019. Those cash flows use\nestimates based on BoCom\u2019s current condition and so do not include estimated cash\nflows arising from uncommitted future actions that may affect the performance of the\ninvestment which will be considered at the relevant time should they arise.\n\u2013 Key assumptions used in estimating BoCom\u2019s value in use and the sensitivity of the\nvalue in use calculations to different assumptions are described in Note 18.\n(b) Income and expense\nOperating income\nInterest income and expense\nInterest income and expense for all financial instruments, excluding those classified as held for trading or designated at fair value, is recognised\nin \u2018Interest income\u2019 and \u2018Interest expense\u2019 in the income statement using the effective interest method. However, as an exception to this,\ninterest on debt instruments issued by HSBC for funding purposes that are designated under the fair value option to reduce an accounting\nmismatch and on derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt instruments is included in interest expense.\nInterest on credit-impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (i.e. gross carrying amount\nof the asset less allowance for expected credit losses).\nNon-interest income and expense\nHSBC generates fee income from services provided over time, such as account service and card fees, or when HSBC delivers a specific\ntransaction at a point in time, such as broking services and import/export services. With the exception of certain fund management and\nperformance fees, all other fees are generated at a fixed price. Fund management and performance fees can be variable depending on the size\nof the customer portfolio and HSBC\u2019s performance as fund manager. Variable fees are recognised when all uncertainties are resolved. Fee\nincome is generally earned from short-term contracts with payment terms that do not include a significant financing component.\nHSBC acts as principal in the majority of contracts with customers, with the exception of broking services. For most brokerage trades, HSBC\nacts as agent in the transaction and recognises broking income net of fees payable to other parties in the arrangement.\nHSBC recognises fees earned on transaction-based arrangements at a point in time when it has fully provided the service to the customer.\nWhere the contract requires services to be provided over time, income is recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the agreement.\nWhere HSBC offers a package of services that contains multiple non-distinct performance obligations, such as those included in account\nservice packages, the promised services are treated as a single performance obligation. If a package of services contains distinct performance\nobligations, the corresponding transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices.\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\nNet income/(expense) from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss includes the following:\n\u2013 \u2018Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis\u2019: This comprises net trading activities, which\nincludes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading and other financial\ninstruments managed on a fair value basis, together with the related interest income, interest expense and dividend income, excluding the\neffect of changes in the credit risk of liabilities managed on a fair value basis. It also includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair\nvalue of derivatives that are managed in conjunction with financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\u2013 \u2018Net income/(expense) from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit\nor loss\u2019: This includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value, together with related interest income, interest expense and\ndividend income in respect of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and those derivatives managed in\nconjunction with the above that can be separately identifiable from other trading derivatives.\n\u2013 \u2018Changes in fair value of designated debt instruments and related derivatives\u2019: Interest paid on debt instruments and interest cash flows on\nrelated derivatives is presented in interest expense where doing so reduces an accounting mismatch.\n\u2013 \u2018Changes in fair value of other financial instruments mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\u2019: This includes interest on\ninstruments that fail the solely payments of principal and interest (\u2018SPPI\u2019) test, see (d) below.\nThe accounting policies for insurance service result and insurance finance income/(expense) are disclosed in Note 1.2(j).", "page_start": 357, "page_end": 358, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is\ngenerally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, if there is a difference between the transaction\nprice and the fair value of financial instruments whose fair value is based on a quoted price in an active market or a valuation technique that uses\nonly data from observable markets, HSBC recognises the difference as a trading gain or loss at inception (a \u2018day 1 gain or loss\u2019). In all other cases,\nthe entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction until the transaction matures, is\nclosed out, the valuation inputs become observable or HSBC enters into an offsetting transaction.\nThe fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on an individual basis. However, in cases where HSBC manages a group of financial\nassets and liabilities according to its net market or credit risk exposure, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis\nbut the underlying financial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the financial statements, unless they satisfy the IFRS offsetting criteria.\nFinancial instruments are classified into one of three fair value hierarchy levels, described in Note 12, \u2018Fair values of financial instruments\ncarried at fair value\u2018.\nCritical estimates and judgements\nThe majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data. However, certain financial instruments are classified on the basis of valuation techniques\nthat feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable, and for them, the measurement of fair value is more judgemental:\nJudgements Estimates\n\u2013 An instrument in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable \u2013 Details on the Group\u2019s Level 3 financial instruments and the\ninputs if, in the opinion of management, greater than 5% of the instrument\u2019s valuation sensitivity of their valuation to the effect of applying reasonably\nis driven by unobservable inputs. possible alternative assumptions in determining their fair value are\n\u2013 \u2018Unobservable\u2019 in this context means that there is little or no current market data set out in Note 12.\navailable from which to determine the price at which an arm\u2019s length transaction would\nbe likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no data available at all upon\nwhich to base a determination of fair value (consensus pricing data may, for example,\nbe used).\n(d) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost\nFinancial assets that are held to collect the contractual cash flows and which contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash\nflows that are solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Such financial assets include most loans and advances\nto banks and customers and some debt securities. In addition, most financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. HSBC accounts for\nregular way amortised cost financial instruments using trade date accounting. The carrying amount of these financial assets at initial recognition\nincludes any directly attributable transactions costs.\nHSBC may commit to underwriting loans on fixed contractual terms for specified periods of time. When the loan arising from the lending\ncommitment is expected to be sold shortly after origination, the commitment to lend is recorded as a derivative. When HSBC intends to hold\nthe loan, the loan commitment is included in the impairment calculations set out below.\nFinancial assets are reclassified only when the business model for their management changes. Such changes, which are expected to be\ninfrequent, are determined by senior management as a result of external or internal changes and must be significant to operations and\ndemonstrable to external parties. Reclassifications are applied prospectively from the first day of the first reporting period following the change\nof business model. Where a financial asset is reclassified out of the amortised cost measurement category and into the fair value through other\ncomprehensive income measurement category its fair value is measured at the date of reclassification. Any gain or loss arising from a\ndifference between the previous amortised cost and fair value is recognised in other comprehensive income. The effective interest rate and the\nmeasurement of expected credit losses are not adjusted as a result of the reclassification.\nNon-trading reverse repurchase, repurchase and similar agreements\nWhen debt securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined price (\u2018repos\u2019), they remain on the balance\nsheet and a liability is recorded in respect of the consideration received. Securities purchased under commitments to resell (\u2018reverse repos\u2019) are\nnot recognised on the balance sheet and an asset is recorded in respect of the initial consideration paid. Non-trading repos and reverse repos\nare measured at amortised cost. The difference between the sale and repurchase price or between the purchase and resale price is treated as\ninterest and recognised in net interest income over the life of the agreement.\nContracts that are economically equivalent to reverse repo or repo agreements (such as sales or purchases of debt securities entered into\ntogether with total return swaps with the same counterparty) are accounted for similarly to, and presented together with, reverse repo or repo\nagreements.\n(e) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\nFinancial assets managed within a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling and which contain\ncontractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are measured at fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income (\u2018FVOCI\u2019). These comprise primarily debt securities. They are recognised on trade date when HSBC\nenters into contractual arrangements to purchase and are generally derecognised when they are either sold or redeemed.

Otherwise, equity securities\nare measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n(g) Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss\nFinancial instruments, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they meet one or more of the criteria set out below and\nare so designated irrevocably at inception:\n\u2013 The use of the designation removes or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.\n\u2013 A group of financial assets and liabilities or a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in\naccordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.\n\u2013 The financial liability contains one or more non-closely related embedded derivatives.\nDesignated financial assets are recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on trade date, and are\nnormally derecognised when the rights to the cash flows expire or are transferred. Designated financial liabilities are recognised when HSBC\nenters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on settlement date, and are normally derecognised when extinguished.\nSubsequent changes in fair values are recognised in the income statement in \u2018Net income from financial instruments held for trading or\nmanaged on a fair value basis\u2019 or \u2018Net income/(expense) from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives,\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss\u2019 or \u2018Changes in fair value of designated debt and related derivatives\u2019 except for the effect of\nchanges in the liabilities\u2019 credit risk, which is presented in \u2018Other comprehensive income\u2019, unless that treatment would create or enlarge an\naccounting mismatch in profit or loss.\nUnder the above criteria, the main classes of financial instruments designated by HSBC are:\n\u2013 Debt instruments for funding purposes that are designated to reduce an accounting mismatch: The interest and/or foreign exchange\nexposure on certain fixed-rate debt securities issued has been matched with the interest and/or foreign exchange exposure on certain\nswaps as part of a documented risk management strategy.\n\u2013 Financial assets and financial liabilities under unit-linked and non-linked investment contracts: A contract under which HSBC does not accept\nsignificant insurance risk from another party is not classified as an insurance contract, other than investment contracts with discretionary\nparticipation features (\u2018DPF\u2019), but is accounted for as a financial liability. Customer liabilities under linked and certain non-linked investment\ncontracts issued by insurance subsidiaries are determined based on the fair value of the assets held in the linked funds or by a valuation\nmethod. The related financial assets and liabilities are managed and reported to management on a fair value basis. Designation at fair value\nof the financial assets and related liabilities allows changes in fair values to be recorded in the income statement and presented in the same\nline.\n\u2013 Financial liabilities that contain both deposit and derivative components: These financial liabilities are managed and their performance\nevaluated on a fair value basis.\n(h) Derivatives\nDerivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, interest rates or other indices.\nDerivatives are recognised initially and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are classified as assets when\ntheir fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. This includes embedded derivatives in financial liabilities, which are\nbifurcated from the host contract when they meet the definition of a derivative on a stand-alone basis.\nWhere the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated at fair value where doing so reduces an\naccounting mismatch, the contractual interest is shown in \u2018Interest expense\u2019 together with the interest payable on the issued debt.\nHedge accounting\nWhen derivatives are not part of fair value designated relationships, if held for risk management purposes they are designated in hedge\naccounting relationships where the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. HSBC uses these derivatives or,\nwhere allowed, other non-derivative hedging instruments in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\noperations as appropriate to the risk being hedged.\nFair value hedge\nFair value hedge accounting does not change the recording of gains and losses on derivatives and other hedging instruments, but results in\nrecognising changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk that would not otherwise be recognised in\nthe income statement. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued and the\ncumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest rate method is used is amortised to the income\nstatement on a recalculated effective interest rate, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income\nstatement immediately.\nCash flow hedge\nThe effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of\nthe change in fair value of derivative hedging instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge relationship is recognised immediately in the\nincome statement within \u2018Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis\u2019.

At initial recognition, an allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is recognised for\nECL resulting from possible default events within the next 12 months, or less, where the remaining life is less than 12 months (\u201912-month\nECL\u2019). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, an allowance (or provision) is recognised for ECL resulting from all possible default\nevents over the expected life of the financial instrument (\u2018lifetime ECL\u2019). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered to\nbe \u2018stage 1\u2019; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in \u2018stage 2\u2019; and financial assets\nfor which there is objective evidence of impairment, and so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired are in \u2018stage 3\u2019.\nPurchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (\u2018POCI\u2019) are treated differently as set out below.\nCredit impaired (stage 3)\nHSBC determines that a financial instrument is credit impaired and in stage 3 by considering relevant objective evidence, primarily whether\ncontractual payments of either principal or interest are past due for more than 90 days, there are other indications that the borrower is unlikely\nto pay such as that a concession has been granted to the borrower for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower\u2019s financial condition,\nor the loan is otherwise considered to be in default.\nIf such unlikeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is deemed to occur when an exposure is 90 days past due. Therefore, the\ndefinitions of credit impaired and default are aligned as far as possible so that stage 3 represents all loans that are considered defaulted or\notherwise credit impaired.\nInterest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (i.e. gross carrying amount less allowance for ECL).\nWrite-off\nFinancial assets (and the related impairment allowances) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of\nrecovery. Where loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security. In circumstances where the\nnet realisable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write-off may be earlier.\nForbearance\nLoans are identified as forborne and classified as either performing or non-performing when HSBC modifies the contractual terms due to\nfinancial difficulty of the borrower. Non-performing forborne loans are stage 3 and classified as non-performing until they meet the curing\ncriteria, as specified by applicable credit risk policy (for example, when the loan is no longer in default and no other indicators of default have\nbeen present for at least 12 months). Any amount written off as a result of any modification of contractual terms upon entering forbearance\nwould not be reversed.\nThe Group applies the EBA Guidelines on the application of definition of default for our retail portfolios, which affect credit risk policies and our\nreporting in respect of the status of loans as credit impaired principally due to forbearance (or curing thereof). Further details are provided under\n\u2018Forborne loans and advances\u2019 on page 140.\nPerforming forborne loans are initially stage 2 and remain classified as forborne until they meet applicable curing criteria (for example, they\ncontinue to not be in default and no other indicators of default are present for a period of at least 24 months). At this point, the loan is either\nstage 1 or stage 2 as determined by comparing the risk of a default occurring at the reporting date (based on the modified contractual terms)\nand the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified contractual terms).\nA forborne loan is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement is made on substantially different terms, or if the\nterms of an existing agreement are modified such that the forborne loan is a substantially different financial instrument. Any new loans that\narise following derecognition events in these circumstances would generally be classified as POCI and will continue to be disclosed as\nforborne.\nLoan modifications other than forborne loans\nLoan modifications that are not identified as forborne are considered to be commercial restructurings. Where a commercial restructuring results\nin a modification (whether legalised through an amendment to the existing terms or the issuance of a new loan contract) such that HSBC\u2019s\nrights to the cash flows under the original contract have expired, the old loan is derecognised and the new loan is recognised at fair value. The\nrights to cash flows are generally considered to have expired if the commercial restructuring is at market rates and no payment-related\nconcession has been provided. Modifications of certain higher credit risk wholesale loans are assessed for derecognition, having regard to\nchanges in contractual terms that either individually or in combination are judged to result in a substantially different financial instrument.\nMandatory and general offer loan modifications that are not borrower specific, for example market-wide customer relief programmes, generally\ndo not result in derecognition, but their stage allocation is determined considering all available and supportable information under our ECL\nimpairment policy. Changes made to these financial instruments that are economically equivalent and required by interest rate benchmark\nreform do not result in the derecognition or a change in the carrying amount of the financial instrument, but instead require the effective\ninterest rate to be updated to reflect the change of the interest rate benchmark.\nFinancial\nstatements", "page_start": 360, "page_end": 361, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

The assessment is unbiased, probability-weighted, and to the extent relevant, uses forward-looking information consistent with that\nused in the measurement of ECL. The analysis of credit risk is multifactor. The determination of whether a specific factor is relevant and its\nweight compared with other factors depends on the type of product, the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower, and the\ngeographical region. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a single set of criteria that will determine what is considered to be a significant\nincrease in credit risk, and these criteria will differ for different types of lending, particularly between retail and wholesale. However, unless\nidentified at an earlier stage, all financial assets are deemed to have suffered a significant increase in credit risk when 30 days past due. In\naddition, wholesale loans that are individually assessed, which are typically corporate and commercial customers, and included on a watch or\nworry list, are included in stage 2.\nFor wholesale portfolios, the quantitative comparison assesses default risk using a lifetime probability of default (\u2018PD\u2019), which encompasses a\nwide range of information including the obligor\u2019s customer risk rating (\u2018CRR\u2019), macroeconomic condition forecasts and credit transition\nprobabilities. For origination CRRs up to 3.3, significant increase in credit risk is measured by comparing the average PD for the remaining term\nestimated at origination with the equivalent estimation at the reporting date. The quantitative measure of significance varies depending on the\ncredit quality at origination as follows:\nOrigination CRR Significance trigger \u2013 PD to increase by\n0.1\u20131.2 15bps\n2.1\u20133.3 30bps\nFor CRRs greater than 3.3 that are not impaired, a significant increase in credit risk is considered to have occurred when the origination PD has\ndoubled. The significance of changes in PD was informed by expert credit risk judgement, referenced to historical credit migrations and to\nrelative changes in external market rates.\nFor loans originated prior to the implementation of IFRS 9, the origination PD does not include adjustments to reflect expectations of future\nmacroeconomic conditions since these are not available without the use of hindsight. In the absence of this data, origination PD must be\napproximated assuming through-the-cycle PDs and through-the-cycle migration probabilities, consistent with the instrument\u2019s underlying\nmodelling approach and the CRR at origination. For these loans, the quantitative comparison is supplemented with additional CRR deterioration-\nbased thresholds, as set out in the table below:\nAdditional significance criteria \u2013 number of CRR grade notches\ndeterioration required to identify as significant credit\nOrigination CRR deterioration (stage 2) (> or equal to)\n0.1 5 notches\n1.1\u20134.2 4 notches\n4.3\u20135.1 3 notches\n5.2\u20137.1 2 notches\n7.2\u20138.2 1 notch\n8.3 0 notch\nFurther information about the 23-grade scale used for CRR can be found on page 139.\nFor retail portfolios, default risk is assessed using a reporting date 12-month PD derived from internal models, which incorporate all available\ninformation about the customer. This PD is adjusted for the effect of macroeconomic forecasts for periods longer than 12 months and is\nconsidered to be a reasonable approximation of a lifetime PD measure. Retail exposures are first segmented into homogenous portfolios,\ngenerally by country, product and brand. Within each portfolio, the stage 2 accounts are defined as accounts with an adjusted 12-month PD\ngreater than the average 12-month PD of loans in that portfolio 12 months before they become 30 days past due. The expert credit risk\njudgement is that no prior increase in credit risk is significant. This portfolio-specific threshold therefore identifies loans with a PD higher than\nwould be expected from loans that are performing as originally expected and higher than that which would have been acceptable at origination.\nIt therefore approximates a comparison of origination to reporting date PDs.\nWe continue to refine the retail transfer criteria approach for certain portfolios as additional data becomes available, in order to utilise a more\nrelative approach. These enhancements take advantage of the increase in origination-related data in the assessment of significant increases in\ncredit risk by comparing remaining lifetime PD to the comparable remaining term lifetime PD at origination based on portfolio-specific\norigination segments.\nUnimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk (stage 1)\nECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (\u201812-month ECL\u2019) are recognised for financial instruments that\nremain in stage 1.\nPurchased or originated credit impaired\nFinancial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses are considered to be POCI. This\npopulation includes new financial instruments recognised in most cases following the derecognition of forborne loans. The amount of change in\nlifetime ECL for a POCI loan is recognised in profit or loss until the POCI loan is derecognised, even if the lifetime ECL are less than the amount\nof ECL included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.\nMovement between stages\nFinancial assets can be transferred between the different categories (other than POCI) depending on their relative increase in credit risk since\ninitial recognition. Financial instruments are transferred out of stage 2 if their credit risk is no longer considered to be significantly increased\nsince initial recognition based on the assessments described above.

In the case of non-performing forborne loans, such financial instruments\nare transferred out of stage 3 when they no longer exhibit any evidence of credit impairment and meet the curing criteria as described above.\nMeasurement of ECL\nThe assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are unbiased and probability-weighted, and incorporate all available information which\nis relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future\nevents and economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money and\nconsiders other factors such as climate-related risks.\nIn general, HSBC calculates ECL using three main components: a probability of default (\u2018PD\u2019), a loss given default (\u2019LGD\u2019) and the exposure at\ndefault (\u2018EAD\u2019).\nThe 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the lifetime PD instead. The\n12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument\nrespectively.\nThe EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to\nthe default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the\nevent of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and\nthe time value of money.\nHSBC makes use of the IRB framework where possible, with recalibration to meet the differing IFRS 9 requirements as set out in the following\ntable:\nModel Regulatory capital IFRS 9\n\u2013 Represents long-run average PD throughout a full economic cycle \u2013 Represents current portfolio quality and performance, adjusted for\n(for mortgage portfolios a hybrid approach, which sits between the the impact of multiple forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios\nextremes of point in time and through the cycle, is used for \u2013 Default backstop of 90+ days past due for all portfolios (includes\nPD calculating long-run averages as required by the PRA) UTP criteria in line with internal policy)\n\u2013 Default backstop of 90+ days past due for all portfolios (includes\nunlikely to pay (\u2018UTP\u2019) criteria in line with internal policy)\n\u2013 May be subject to a sovereign cap\nEAD \u2013 Cannot be lower than current balance \u2013 Amortisation captured for term products\n\u2013 Future drawdown captured for revolving products\n\u2013 Downturn LGD (consistent with losses we would expect to suffer \u2013 LGD based on recent portfolio performance data and includes the\nduring a severe but plausible economic downturn) expected impact of future economic conditions such as change in\n\u2013 Regulatory floors may apply to mitigate risk of underestimating the value of collateral\nLGD\ndownturn LGD due to lack of historical data \u2013 No floors applied, discounted using the original effective interest rate\n\u2013 Discounted using appropriate index (minimum 9%) \u2013 Only costs associated with selling collateral and certain third-party\n\u2013 All collection costs included costs are included\nOther \u2013 Discounted back from point of default to balance sheet date\nWhile 12-month PDs are recalibrated from IRB models where possible, the lifetime PDs are determined by projecting the 12-month PD using a\nterm structure. For the wholesale methodology, the lifetime PD also takes into account credit migration, i.e. a customer migrating through the\nCRR bands over its life.\nThe ECL for wholesale stage 3 is determined primarily on an individual basis using a discounted cash flow (\u2018DCF\u2019) methodology. The expected\nfuture cash flows are based on estimates as of the reporting date, reflecting reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of future\nrecoveries and expected future receipts of interest.\nCollateral is taken into account if it is likely that the recovery of the outstanding amount will include realisation of collateral based on its\nestimated fair value of collateral at the time of expected realisation, less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral.\nThe cash flows are discounted at a reasonable approximation of the original effective interest rate. For significant cases, cash flows under up to\nfour different scenarios are probability-weighted by reference to the status of the borrower, economic scenarios applied more generally by the\nGroup and judgement in relation to the likelihood of the work-out strategy succeeding or receivership being required. For less significant cases\nwhere an individual assessment is undertaken, the effect of different economic scenarios and work-out strategies results in an ECL calculation\nbased on a most likely outcome which is adjusted to capture losses resulting from less likely but possible outcomes. For certain less significant\ncases, the bank may use an LGD-based modelled approach to ECL assessment, which factors in a range of economic scenarios.\nPeriod over which ECL is measured\nExpected credit loss is measured from the initial recognition of the financial asset. The maximum period considered when measuring ECL (be it\n12-month or lifetime ECL) is the maximum contractual period over which HSBC is exposed to credit risk. However, where the financial\ninstrument includes both a drawn and undrawn commitment and the contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn\ncommitment does not serve to limit HSBC\u2019s exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice period, the contractual period does not determine\nthe maximum period considered. Instead, ECL is measured over the period HSBC remains exposed to credit risk that is not mitigated by credit\nrisk management actions. This applies to retail overdrafts and credit cards, where the period is the average time taken for stage 2 exposures to\ndefault or close as performing accounts, determined on a portfolio basis and ranging from between two and six years. In addition, for these\nfacilities it is not possible to identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from the financial asset component. As a result,\nthe total ECL is recognised in the loss allowance for the financial asset unless the total ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial\nasset, in which case the ECL is recognised as a provision. For wholesale overdraft facilities, credit risk management actions are taken no less\nfrequently than on an annual basis.\nForward-looking economic inputs\nHSBC applies multiple forward-looking global economic scenarios determined with reference to external forecast distributions representative of\nits view of forecast economic conditions. This approach is considered sufficient to calculate unbiased expected credit losses in most economic\nenvironments. In certain economic environments, additional analysis may be necessary and may result in additional scenarios or adjustments,\nto reflect a range of possible economic outcomes sufficient for an unbiased estimate.

The most significant are set\nout below:\nJudgements Estimates\n\u2013 Defining what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk \u2013 The section \u2018Measurement uncertainty and\n\u2013 Determining the lifetime and point of initial recognition of overdrafts and credit cards sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates\u2019, marked as\naudited from page 147, sets out the assumptions\n\u2013 Selecting and calibrating the PD, LGD and EAD models, which support the calculations, including\nused in determining ECL, and provides an indication\nmaking reasonable and supportable judgements about how models react to current and future\nof the sensitivity of the result to the application of\neconomic conditions\ndifferent weightings being applied to different\n\u2013 Selecting model inputs and economic forecasts, including determining whether sufficient and economic assumptions\nappropriately weighted economic forecasts are incorporated to calculate unbiased expected credit loss\n\u2013 Making management adjustments to account for late-breaking events, model and data limitations and\ndeficiencies, and expert credit judgements\n\u2013 Selecting applicable recovery strategies for certain wholesale credit-impaired loans\n(j) Insurance contracts\nA contract is classified as an insurance contract where the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing to\ncompensate that party if it is adversely affected by a specified uncertain future event. An insurance contract may also transfer financial risk, but\nis accounted for as an insurance contract if the insurance risk is significant. In addition, the Group issues investment contracts with\ndiscretionary participation features ('DPF\u2019), which are also accounted under IFRS 17 \u2019Insurance Contracts\u2019.\nAggregation of insurance contracts\nIndividual insurance contracts that are managed together and subject to similar risks are identified as a portfolio. Contracts that are managed\ntogether usually belong to the same product group, and have similar characteristics such as being subject to a similar pricing framework or\nsimilar product management, and are issued by the same legal entity. If a contract is exposed to more than one risk, the dominant risk of the\ncontract is used to assess whether the contract features similar risks. Each portfolio is further separated by the contract\u2019s expected profitability.\nThe portfolios are split by their profitability into: (i) contracts that are onerous at initial recognition; (ii) contracts that at initial recognition have no\nsignificant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently; and (iii) the remaining contracts. These profitability groups are then divided by issue\ndate, with most contracts the Group issues after the transition date being grouped into calendar quarter cohorts. For multi-currency groups of\ncontracts, the Group considers its groups of contracts as being denominated in a single currency.\nThe measurement of the insurance contract liability is based on groups of insurance contracts as established at initial recognition, and will\ninclude fulfilment cash flows as well as the CSM representing the unearned profit. The Group\u2019s accounting policy is to update the estimates\nused in the measurement on a year-to-date basis.\nFulfilment cash flows\nThe fulfilment cash flows comprise the following:\nBest estimates of future cash flows\nThe cash flows within the contract boundary of each contract in the Group include amounts expected to be collected from premiums and\npayouts for claims, benefits and expenses, and are projected using a range of scenarios and assumptions in an unbiased way based on the\nGroup\u2019s demographic and operating experience along with external mortality data where the Group\u2019s own experience data is not sufficiently\nlarge in size to be credible.\nAdjustment for the time value of money and financial risks associated with the future cash flows\nThe estimates of future cash flows are adjusted to reflect the time value of money (i.e. discounting) and the financial risks to derive an\nexpected present value. The Group generally makes use of stochastic modelling techniques in the estimation for products with options and\nguarantees.\nA bottom-up approach is used to determine the discount rate to be applied to a given set of expected future cash flows. This is derived as the\nsum of the risk-free yield and an illiquidity premium. The risk-free yield is determined based on observable market data, where such markets\nare considered to be deep, liquid and transparent. When information is not available, management judgement is applied to determine the\nappropriate risk-free yield. Illiquidity premiums reflect the liquidity characteristics of the associated insurance contracts.\nRisk adjustment for non-financial risk\nThe risk adjustment reflects the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of future cash flows that arises\nfrom non-financial risk. It is calculated as a 75th percentile level of stress over a one-year period. The level of the stress is determined with\nreference to external regulatory stresses and internal economic capital stresses.\nFor the main insurance manufacturing entity in these locations, the one-year 75th percentile level of stress corresponds to the following\npercentiles based on an ultimate view of risk over all future years:\n\u2013 Asia-Pacific (Hong Kong): 60th percentile (2023: 60th percentile).\n\u2013 Europe (France): 60th percentile (2023: 60th percentile).\n\u2013 Latin America (Mexico): 64th percentile (2023: 65th percentile).\nThe Group does not disaggregate changes in the risk adjustment between insurance service result (comprising insurance revenue and\ninsurance service expense) and insurance finance income or expenses.

All changes are included in the insurance service result.\nMeasurement models\nThe variable fee approach (\u2018VFA\u2019) measurement model is used for most of the contracts issued by the Group, which is mandatory upon\nmeeting the following eligibility criteria at inception:\n\u2013 the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n\u2013 the Group expects to pay to the policyholder a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items. The Group considers that a\nsubstantial share is a majority of returns; and\n\u2013 the Group expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value\nof the underlying items. The Group considers that a substantial proportion is a majority proportion of change on a present value probability-\nweighted average of all scenarios.\nFor some contracts measured under VFA, the other comprehensive income (\u2018OCI\u2019) option is used. The OCI option is applied where the\nunderlying items held by the Group are not accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Under this option, only the amount that matches\nincome or expenses recognised in profit or loss on underlying items is included in finance income or expenses for these insurance contracts,\nand hence results in the elimination of accounting mismatches. The remaining amount of finance income or expenses for these insurance\ncontracts issued for the period is recognised in OCI. In addition, the risk mitigation option is used for a number of economic offsets against the\ninstruments that meet specific requirements.\nThe remaining contracts issued and the reinsurance contracts held are accounted for under the general measurement model (\u2018GMM\u2019).\nCSM and coverage units\nThe CSM represents the unearned profit and results in no income or expense at initial recognition when the group of contracts is profitable.\nThe CSM is adjusted at each subsequent reporting period for changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service (e.g. changes in non-\neconomic assumptions, including mortality and morbidity rates). For initial recognition of onerous groups of contracts and when groups of\ncontracts become onerous subsequently, losses are recognised in insurance service expense immediately.\nFor groups of contracts measured using the VFA, changes in the Group\u2019s share of the underlying items, and economic experience and\neconomic assumption changes adjust the CSM, whereas these changes do not adjust the CSM under the GMM, but are recognised in profit or\nloss as they arise. However, under the risk mitigation option for VFA contracts, the changes in the fulfilment cash flows and the changes in the\nGroup\u2019s share in the fair value return on underlying items that the instruments mitigate are not adjusted in CSM but recognised in profit or loss.\nThe risk mitigating instruments are primarily reinsurance contracts held.\nThe CSM is systematically recognised in insurance revenue to reflect the insurance contract services provided, based on the coverage units of\nthe group of contracts. Coverage units are determined by the quantity of benefits and the expected coverage period of the contracts.\nThe Group identifies the quantity of the benefits provided as follows:\n\u2013 Insurance coverage: This is based on the expected net policyholder insurance benefit at each period after allowance for decrements, where\nnet policyholder insurance benefit refers to the amount of sum assured less the fund value or surrender value.\n\u2013 Investment services (including both investment-return service and investment-related service): This is based on a constant measure basis\nwhich reflects the provision of access for the policyholder to the facility.\nFor contracts that provide both insurance coverage and investment services, coverage units are weighted according to the expected present\nvalue of the future cash outflows for each service.\nInsurance service result\nInsurance revenue reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the provision of coverage and other insurance\ncontract services (excluding any investment components). Insurance service expenses comprise the incurred claims and other incurred insurance\nservice expenses (excluding any investment components), and losses on onerous groups of contracts and reversals of such losses.\nInsurance finance income and expenses\nInsurance finance income and expenses comprise the change in the carrying amount of the group of insurance contracts arising from the\neffects of the time value of money, financial risk and changes therein. For VFA contracts, changes in the fair value of underlying items\n(excluding additions and withdrawals) are recognised in insurance finance income or expenses.\n(k) Employee compensation and benefits\nShare-based payments\nHSBC enters into both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment arrangements with its employees as compensation for the\nprovision of their services.\nThe vesting period for these schemes may commence before the legal grant date if the employees have started to render services in respect\nof the award before the legal grant date, where there is a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Expenses are\nrecognised when the employee starts to render service to which the award relates.\nCancellations result from the failure to meet a non-vesting condition during the vesting period, and are treated as an acceleration of vesting\nrecognised immediately in the income statement. Failure to meet a vesting condition by the employee is not treated as a cancellation, and the\namount of expense recognised for the award is adjusted to reflect the number of awards expected to vest.\nFinancial\nstatements", "page_start": 364, "page_end": 365, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

The net charge to the income statement mainly\ncomprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability, and is presented in operating expenses.\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets (excluding\ninterest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The net\ndefined benefit asset or liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets (see Note\n1.2(c)), after applying the asset ceiling test, where the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds and\nreductions in future contributions to the plan.\nThe costs of obligations arising from other post-employment plans are accounted for on the same basis as defined benefit pension plans.\nCritical estimates and judgements\nThe most significant critical estimates relate to the determination of key assumptions applied in calculating the defined benefit pension obligation for the principal\nplan.\nJudgements Estimates\n\u2013 A range of assumptions could be applied, and different assumptions could\nsignificantly alter the defined benefit obligation and the amounts\nrecognised in profit or loss or OCI.\n\u2013 The calculation of the defined benefit pension obligation includes\nassumptions with regard to the discount rate, inflation rate, pension\npayments and deferred pensions, pay and mortality. Management\ndetermines these assumptions in consultation with the plan\u2019s actuaries.\n\u2013 Key assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit pension\nobligation for the principal plan and the sensitivity of the calculation to\ndifferent assumptions are described in Note 5.\n(l) Tax\nIncome tax comprises current tax and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to\nitems recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised in the same statement as the related\nitem appears.\nCurrent tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year and on any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous\nyears. HSBC provides for potential current tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, and the\namounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply in the periods\nin which the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled.\nIn assessing the probability and sufficiency of future taxable profit, management considers the availability of evidence to support the\nrecognition of deferred tax assets, taking into account the inherent risks in long-term forecasting, including climate change-related, and drivers\nof recent history of tax losses where applicable. Management also considers the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and\ntax planning strategies, including corporate reorganisations.\nCurrent and deferred tax are calculated based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.\nCritical estimates and judgements\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets depends on judgements and estimates.\nJudgements Estimates\n\u2013 Specific judgements supporting deferred tax assets are described in Note 7. \u2013 The recognition of deferred tax assets is sensitive to estimates of future\ncash flows projected for periods for which detailed forecasts are available\nand to assumptions regarding the long-term pattern of cash flows\nthereafter, on which forecasts of future taxable profit are based, and\nwhich affect the expected recovery periods and the pattern of utilisation\nof tax losses and tax credits. See Note 7 for further detail.\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of deferred tax assets in the next\nfinancial year, but does consider this to be an area that is inherently judgemental.\n(m) Provisions, contingent liabilities and guarantees\nProvisions\nProvisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present legal or constructive\nobligation that has arisen as a result of past events and for which a reliable estimate can be made.", "page_start": 365, "page_end": 366, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

The most significant are set out\nbelow:\nJudgements Estimates\n\u2013 Determining whether a present obligation exists. Professional advice is taken on \u2013 Provisions for legal proceedings and regulatory matters remain very\nthe assessment of litigation and similar obligations. sensitive to the assumptions used in the estimate. There could be a wider\n\u2013 Provisions for legal proceedings and regulatory matters typically require a higher range of possible outcomes for any pending legal proceedings,\ndegree of judgement than other types of provisions. When matters are at an investigations or inquiries. As a result it is often not practicable to quantify\nearly stage, accounting judgements can be difficult because of the high degree of a range of possible outcomes for individual matters. It is also not\nuncertainty associated with determining whether a present obligation exists, and practicable to meaningfully quantify ranges of potential outcomes in\nestimating the probability and amount of any outflows that may arise. As matters aggregate for these types of provisions because of the diverse nature and\nprogress, management and legal advisers evaluate on an ongoing basis whether circumstances of such matters and the wide range of uncertainties\nprovisions should be recognised, revising previous estimates as appropriate. At involved.\nmore advanced stages, it is typically easier to make estimates around a better\ndefined set of possible outcomes.\nContingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees\nContingent liabilities\nContingent liabilities, which include certain guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security, and contingent liabilities related to\nlegal proceedings or regulatory matters, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of settlement is\nremote.\nFinancial guarantee contracts\nLiabilities under financial guarantee contracts that are not classified as insurance contracts are recorded initially at their fair value, which is\ngenerally the fee received or present value of the fee receivable.\n(n) Impairment of non-financial assets\nSoftware under development is tested for impairment at least annually. Other non-financial assets are property, plant and equipment, intangible\nassets (excluding goodwill) and right-of-use assets. They are tested for impairment at the individual asset level when there is indication of\nimpairment at that level, or at the CGU level for assets that do not have a recoverable amount at the individual asset level. In addition,\nimpairment is also tested at the CGU level when there is indication of impairment at that level. For this purpose, CGUs are considered to be the\nprincipal operating legal entities divided by global business. Impairment testing compares the carrying amount of the non-financial asset or CGU\nwith its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use. The carrying amount of a CGU\ncomprises the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities, including non-financial assets that are directly attributable to it and non-financial\nassets that can be allocated to it on a reasonable and consistent basis. Non-financial assets that cannot be allocated to an individual CGU are\ntested for impairment at an appropriate grouping of CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of the fair value less costs of\ndisposal of the CGU, which is determined by independent and qualified valuers where relevant, and the value in use, which is calculated based\non appropriate inputs (see Note 21).\nWhen the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the\nextent that the impairment can be allocated on a pro-rata basis to the non-financial assets by reducing their carrying amounts to the higher of\ntheir respective individual recoverable amount or nil. Impairment is not allocated to the financial assets in a CGU.\nImpairment losses recognised in prior periods for non-financial assets are reversed when there has been a change in the estimate used to\ndetermine the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the non-financial assets would\nnot exceed the amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior\nperiods.\nCritical estimates and judgements\nThe review of goodwill and other non-financial assets for impairment reflects management\u2019s best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates\nused to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as described in the \u2018Critical estimates and judgements\u2019 in Note 1.2(a).\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill and non-financial assets\nin the next financial year, but does consider this to be an area that is inherently judgemental.\n(o) Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\nHSBC classifies non-current assets or disposal groups (including assets and liabilities) as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be\nrecovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. To be classified as held for sale, the non-current asset or disposal group\nmust be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or\ndisposal groups), and the sale must be highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable, the appropriate level of management must be\ncommitted to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group) and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been\ninitiated. Further, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value.\nIn addition, the sale should be expected to qualify as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification and actions required to\ncomplete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nHeld for sale assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except for those\nassets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS 5. If the carrying amount of the non-current asset\n(or disposal group) is greater than the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset or\ndisposal group to fair value less costs to sell is recognised. Any such impairment loss is first allocated against the non-current assets that are in\nscope of IFRS 5 for measurement. This first reduces the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the disposal group, and then to the other\nnon-current assets of the disposal group pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the disposal group. Thereafter, any\nimpairment loss in excess of the carrying amount of the non-current assets in scope of IFRS 5 for measurement is recognised against the total\nassets of the disposal group.\nFinancial\nstatements", "page_start": 366, "page_end": 367, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

The largest defined benefit plan is\nthe HSBC UK section of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme (\u2018the principal plan\u2019), created as a result of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme\nbeing fully sectionalised in 2018 to meet the requirements of the Banking Reform Act. For further details of how the trustee of the HSBC Bank\n(UK) Pension Scheme manages climate risk, see \u2019Managing climate risk\u2019 on page 60.\nHSBC holds on its balance sheet the net surplus or deficit, which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the discounted\nvalue of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date for each plan. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable\nthrough reduced contributions in the future or through potential future refunds from the schemes. In assessing whether a surplus is\nrecoverable, HSBC has considered its current right to obtain a future refund or a reduction in future contributions together with the rights of\nthird parties such as trustees.\nThe principal plan\nThe principal plan has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section. The defined benefit section was closed to future benefit\naccrual in 2015, with defined benefits earned by employees at that date continuing to be linked to their salary while they remain employed by\nHSBC. The plan is overseen by an independent corporate trustee, who has a fiduciary responsibility for the operation of the plan. Its assets are\nheld separately from the assets of the Group.\nThe investment strategy of the plan is to hold the majority of assets in bonds, with the remainder in a diverse range of investments. It also\nincludes some interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk, inflation swaps to reduce inflation risk and longevity swaps to reduce the impact\nof longer life expectancy.\nThe principal plan is subject to the statutory funding objective requirements of the UK Pensions Act 2004, which requires that it be funded to at\nleast the level of technical provisions (an actuarial estimate of the assets needed to provide for the benefits already built up under the plan).\nWhere a funding valuation is carried out and identifies a deficit, the employer and trustee are required to agree to a deficit recovery plan.\nThe latest funding valuation of the plan at 31 December 2022 was carried out by Towers Watson Limited, using the projected unit credit\nmethod. At that date, the market value of the plan\u2019s assets was \u00a323.9bn ($28.8bn) and this exceeded the value placed on its liabilities on an\nongoing basis by \u00a33.7bn ($4.4bn), giving a funding level of 118%. These figures include defined contribution assets amounting to \u00a33.0bn\n($3.6bn). The main differences between the assumptions used for assessing the defined benefit liabilities for this funding valuation and those\nused for IAS 19 are that an element of prudence is contained in the funding valuation assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate and life\nexpectancy. The funding valuation is used to judge the amount of cash contributions the Group needs to put into the pension scheme. It will\nalways be different to the IAS 19 accounting surplus, which is an accounting rule concerning employee benefits and shown on the balance\nsheet of our financial statements. The next funding valuation will be performed in 2026, with an effective date of 31 December 2025.\nThe actuary also assessed the value of the liabilities if the plan were to have been stopped and an insurance company asked to secure all future\npension payments. This is generally larger than the amount needed on the ongoing basis described above because an insurance company\nwould use more prudent assumptions, which would allow for reserves and include an explicit allowance for the future administrative expenses\nof the plan. Under this approach, the amount of assets needed was estimated to be \u00a321.3bn ($25.7bn) at 31 December 2022.\nThe trust deed gives the ability for HSBC UK to take a refund of surplus assets after the plan has been run down such that no further\nbeneficiaries remain. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, HSBC UK has considered its right to obtain a future refund together with\nthe rights of third parties such as trustees. On this basis, any net surplus in the HSBC UK section of the plan is recognised in HSBC UK\u2019s\nfinancial statements and the Group\u2019s financial statements.\nIncome statement charge/(credit)\n2024 2023 2022\n$m $m $m\nDefined benefit pension plans (116) (151) 42\nDefined contribution pension plans 933 874 845\nPension plans 817 723 887\nDefined benefit and contribution healthcare plans 34 34 28\nYear ended 31 Dec 851 757 915\nNet assets/(liabilities) recognised on the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans\nFair value of Present value of defined Effect of limit on plan\nplan assets benefit obligations surpluses Total\n$m $m $m $m\nDefined benefit pension plans 30,758 (23,959) \u2014 6,799\nDefined benefit healthcare plans 80 (348) \u2014 (268)\nAt 31 Dec 2024 30,838 (24,307) \u2014 6,531\nTotal employee benefit liabilities (within Note 27 \u2018Accruals, deferred\nincome and other liabilities\u2019) (1,017)\nTotal employee benefit assets (within Note 22 \u2018Prepayments,\naccrued income and other assets\u2019) 7,548\nDefined benefit pension plans 33,897 (27,011) \u2014 6,886\nDefined benefit healthcare plans 107 (403) \u2014 (296)\nAt 31 Dec 2023 34,004 (27,414) \u2014 6,590\nTotal employee benefit liabilities (within Note 27 \u2018Accruals, deferred\nincome and other liabilities\u2019) (1,160)\nTotal employee benefit assets (within Note 22 \u2018Prepayments,\naccrued income and other assets\u2019) 7,750", "page_start": 377, "page_end": 378, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

Management\u2019s assessment of the likely availability of future taxable profits against which\nto recover deferred tax assets is based on the most recent financial forecasts approved by management, which cover a five-year period and are\nextrapolated where necessary, and takes into consideration the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and past business\nperformance. When forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years, a number of different scenarios are considered, reflecting different\ndownward risk adjustments, in order to assess the sensitivity of our recognition and measurement conclusions in the context of such longer-\nterm forecasts.\nThe Group\u2019s net deferred tax asset of $5.5bn (2023: $6.5bn) included $2.6bn (2023: $3.3bn) of deferred tax assets relating to the UK, $3.0bn\n(2023: $3.1bn) of deferred tax assets relating to the US and a net deferred asset of $0.5bn (2023: $0.9bn) in France.\nThe UK deferred tax asset of $2.6bn excluded a $1.8bn deferred tax liability arising on the UK pension scheme surplus, the reversal of which is\nnot taken into account when estimating future taxable profit due to the level of uncertainty as to the timing and manner of its reversal. The UK\ndeferred tax assets are supported by forecasts of taxable profit, also taking into consideration the history of profitability in the relevant\nbusinesses. The majority of the deferred tax asset relates to tax attributes which do not expire and are forecast to be recovered within 3 years\nand as such are less sensitive to changes in long-term profit forecasts.\nThe net US deferred tax asset of $3.0bn included $1.2bn related to US tax losses, of which $0.9bn expire in 10 to 15 years. Management\nexpects the US deferred tax asset to be substantially recovered within 13 years, with the majority recovered in the first 5 years.\nThe net deferred tax asset in France of $0.5bn included $0.5bn related to tax losses, which are expected to be substantially recovered within\n12 years. Unused tax losses with a tax value of $0.2bn have not been recognised due to the absence of convincing evidence regarding the\navailability of sufficient future taxable profits against which to recover them.\nUnrecognised deferred tax\nThe amount of gross temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance\nsheet was $11.0bn (2023: $10.4bn). This amount included unused US state tax losses of $3.8bn (2023: $4.0bn) which are forecast to expire\nbefore they are recovered, unused French tax losses of $0.7bn (2023: nil) for which there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits to\nsupport recognition, and unused UK tax losses of $3.5bn (2023: $4.5bn), which arose prior to 1 April 2017 and can only be recovered against\nfuture taxable profits of HSBC Holdings. No deferred tax was recognised on these losses due to the absence of convincing evidence regarding\nthe availability of sufficient future taxable profits against which to recover them. Deferred tax asset recognition is reassessed at each balance\nsheet date based on the available evidence. Of the total amounts on which deferred tax was not recognised, $6.0bn (2023: $5.1bn) had no\nexpiry date, $1.0bn (2023: $0.5bn) was scheduled to expire within 10 years and the remaining balance is expected to expire after 10 years.\nDeferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Group\u2019s investments in subsidiaries and branches where HSBC is able to control the timing of\nremittance or other realisation and where remittance or realisation is not probable in the foreseeable future. The aggregate temporary\ndifferences relating to unrecognised deferred tax liabilities arising on investments in subsidiaries and branches was $15.2bn (2023: $14.4bn)\nand the corresponding unrecognised deferred tax liability was $0.7bn (2023: $0.7bn).\nFinancial\nstatements", "page_start": 382, "page_end": 383, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by\ndividing the basic earnings, which require no adjustment for the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, by the weighted average number\nof ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own shares held, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on\nconversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\n2024 2023 2022\nNumber Per Number Per Number Per\nProfit of shares share Profit of shares share Profit of shares share\n$m (millions) $ $m (millions) $ $m (millions) $\nBasic1 22,917 18,357 1.25 22,432 19,478 1.15 14,346 19,849 0.72\nEffect of dilutive potential\nordinary shares 128 122 137\nDiluted1 22,917 18,485 1.24 22,432 19,600 1.14 14,346 19,986 0.72\n1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (basic) or assuming dilution (diluted) after deducting own shares held.\nThe number of anti-dilutive employee share options excluded from the weighted average number of dilutive potential ordinary shares was Nil\n(2023: 23 million; 2022: 9.4 million).\n10 Segmental analysis\nThe Group CEO, supported by the rest of the Group Executive Committee (\u2018GEC\u2019), was considered the Chief Operating Decision Maker\n(\u2018CODM\u2019) during the reporting period for the purposes of identifying the Group\u2019s reportable segments. As the reorganisation only took effect\nfrom 1 January 2025, it has no effect on the 2024 segmental reporting. Global business results were assessed by the CODM on the basis of\nconstant currency performance that removes the effects of currency translation from reported results. Therefore, we disclose these results on\na constant currency basis as required by IFRS Accounting Standards. The 2023 and 2022 income statements are converted at the average rates\nof exchange for 2024, and the balance sheets at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 at the prevailing rates of exchange on\n31 December 2024.\nOur operations are closely integrated and, accordingly, the presentation of data includes internal allocations of certain items of income and\nexpense. These allocations include the costs of certain support services and global functions to the extent that they can be meaningfully\nattributed to global businesses. While such allocations have been made on a systematic and consistent basis, they involve a certain degree of\nsubjectivity. Costs that are not allocated to global businesses are included in Corporate Centre.\nWhere relevant, income and expense amounts presented include the results of inter-segment funding along with inter-company and inter-\nbusiness line transactions. All such transactions are undertaken on arm\u2019s length terms. Measurement of segmental assets, liabilities, income\nand expenses is in accordance with the Group\u2019s accounting policies. Shared costs are included in segments on the basis of actual recharges.\nThe intra-group elimination items for the global businesses are presented in Corporate Centre.\nOur global businesses\nWe provide a comprehensive range of banking and related financial services to our customers in our three global businesses.

For inactive markets, HSBC sources alternative market information, with greater weight given to\ninformation that is considered to be more relevant and reliable. Examples of the factors considered are price observability, instrument\ncomparability, consistency of data sources, underlying data accuracy and timing of prices.\nFor fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework includes development or validation by independent support functions\nof the model logic, inputs, model outputs and adjustments. Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence before becoming\noperational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis.\nChanges in fair value are generally subject to a profit and loss analysis process and are disaggregated into high-level categories including\nportfolio changes, market movements and other fair value adjustments.\nThe majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GBM. GBM\u2019s fair value governance structure comprises its Finance function,\nValuation Committees and a Valuation Committee Review Group. Finance is responsible for establishing procedures governing valuation and\nensuring fair values are in compliance with accounting standards. The fair values are reviewed by the Valuation Committees, which consist of\nindependent support functions. These committees are overseen by the Valuation Committee Review Group, which considers all material\nsubjective valuations.\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value\nIn certain circumstances, HSBC records its own debt in issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific\ninstrument. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for which are\neither based on quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices in an active market\nfor similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread that is appropriate to HSBC\u2019s liabilities. The\nchange in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the Group\u2019s own credit spread is computed as follows: for each security at each\nreporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar securities for the same issuer. Then,\nusing discounted cash flow, each security is valued using an appropriate market discount curve. The difference in the valuations is attributable\nto the Group\u2019s own credit spread.

Adjustments are calculated using model infrastructure including those within primary valuation\nsystems. We classify fair value adjustments as either \u2018risk-related\u2019 or \u2018model-related\u2019. The majority of these adjustments relate to MSS.\nMovements in the amount of fair value adjustments do not necessarily translate in equivalent movements of profits or losses within the\nincome statement, as these movements can be compensated by other related profits or loss effects. For example, as models are enhanced,\nfair value adjustments may no longer be required. Similarly, fair value adjustments will decrease when the related positions are unwound, but\nthis may not result in profit or loss.\nFair value adjustments\n2024 2023\nCorporate Corporate\nGBM Centre GBM Centre\n$m $m $m $m\nType of adjustment\nRisk-related 634 35 692 41\n\u2013 bid-offer 366 2 414 \u2014\n\u2013 uncertainty 98 3 75 3\n\u2013 credit valuation adjustment 126 27 164 35\n\u2013 debit valuation adjustment (24) \u2014 (54) \u2014\n\u2013 funding fair value adjustment 68 3 93 3\nModel-related 50 \u2014 63 \u2014\n\u2013 model limitation 50 \u2014 63 \u2014\nInception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves) 92 \u2014 86 \u2014\nAt 31 Dec 776 35 841 41\nThe net reduction in fair value adjustments was predominantly driven by changes to exposure, and tightening of credit and liquidity market\nspreads.\nBid-offer\nIFRS 13 \u2018Fair Value Measurement\u2019 requires the use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. Valuation\nmodels will typically generate mid-market values. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if\nsubstantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by disposing of or unwinding the position.\nUncertainty\nCertain model inputs may be less readily determinable from market data and/or the choice of model itself may be more subjective. In these\ncircumstances, an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the likelihood that market participants would adopt more conservative values for\nuncertain parameters and/or model assumptions than those used in HSBC\u2019s valuation model.\nCredit and debit valuation adjustments\nThe credit valuation adjustment (\u2018CVA\u2019) is an adjustment to the valuation of over-the-counter (\u2018OTC\u2019) derivative contracts to reflect the possibility\nthat the counterparty may default and that HSBC may not receive the full market value of the transactions.\nThe debit valuation adjustment (\u2018DVA\u2019) is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect the possibility that HSBC may\ndefault, and that it may not pay the full market value of the transactions. The DVA considers the overlap with the funding fair value adjustment.\nHSBC calculates a separate CVA and DVA for each legal entity, and for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure. With the exception\nof central clearing parties, all third-party counterparties are included in the CVA and DVA calculations, and these adjustments are not netted\nacross Group entities.\nHSBC calculates the CVA by applying the probability of default (\u2018PD\u2019) of the counterparty, conditional on the non-default of HSBC, to HSBC\u2019s\nexpected positive exposure to the counterparty and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. Conversely, HSBC calculates\nthe DVA by applying the PD of HSBC, conditional on the non-default of the counterparty, to the expected positive exposure of the counterparty to\nHSBC and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. Both calculations are performed over the life of the potential exposure.\nFor most products HSBC uses a simulation methodology, which incorporates a range of potential exposures over the life of the portfolio, to\ncalculate the expected positive exposure to a counterparty. The simulation methodology includes credit mitigants, such as counterparty netting\nagreements and collateral agreements with the counterparty.\nThe methodologies do not, in general, account for \u2018wrong-way risk\u2019. Wrong-way risk is an adverse correlation between the counterparty\u2019s probability of\ndefault and the mark-to-market value of the underlying transaction. The risk can either be general, perhaps related to the currency of the issuer country,\nor specific to the transaction concerned. When there is significant wrong-way risk, a trade-specific approach is applied to reflect this risk in the valuation.\nFunding fair value adjustment\nThe funding fair value adjustment (\u2018FFVA\u2019) is calculated by applying future market funding spreads to the expected future funding exposure of\nany uncollateralised component of the OTC derivative portfolio. The expected future funding exposure is calculated by a simulation\nmethodology, where available, and is adjusted for events that may terminate the exposure, such as the default of HSBC or the counterparty.\nModel limitation\nModels used for portfolio valuation purposes may be based upon a simplified set of assumptions that do not capture all current and future\nmaterial market characteristics. In these circumstances, model limitation adjustments are adopted.", "page_start": 389, "page_end": 390, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

Loans held for securitisation, derivatives with monolines, certain \u2018other\nderivatives\u2019 and predominantly all Level 3 asset-backed securities are legacy positions. HSBC has the capability to hold these positions.\nPrivate equity including strategic investments\nThe fair value of a private equity investment (including strategic investments) is estimated on the basis of an analysis of the investee\u2019s financial\nposition and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors; by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market;\nthe price at which similar companies have changed ownership; or from published net asset values (\u2018NAV\u2019) received. If necessary, adjustments\nare made to the NAV of funds to obtain the best estimate of fair value.\nAsset-backed securities\nWhile quoted market prices are generally used to determine the fair value of the asset-backed securities (\u2018ABSs\u2019), valuation models are used to\nsubstantiate the reliability of the limited market data available and to identify whether any adjustments to quoted market prices are required.\nFor certain ABSs, such as residential mortgage-backed securities, the valuation uses an industry standard model with assumptions relating to\nprepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity based on collateral type, and performance, as appropriate. The valuations output is\nbenchmarked for consistency against observable data for securities of a similar nature.\nStructured notes\nThe fair value of Level 3 structured notes is derived from the fair value of the underlying debt security, and the fair value of the embedded derivative is\ndetermined as described in the paragraph below on derivatives. These structured notes comprise principally equity-linked notes issued by HSBC,\nwhich provide the counterparty with a return linked to the performance of equity securities and other portfolios. Examples of the unobservable\nparameters include long-dated equity volatilities and correlations between equity prices, and interest and foreign exchange rates.\nDerivatives\nOTC derivative valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based upon \u2018no arbitrage\u2019 principles. For many\nvanilla derivative products, the modelling approaches used are standard across the industry. For more complex derivative products, there may\nbe some differences in market practice. Inputs to valuation models are determined from observable market data wherever possible, including\nprices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market\ndirectly, but can be determined from observable prices via model calibration procedures or estimated from historical data or other sources.\nFinancial\nstatements", "page_start": 390, "page_end": 391, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

The analysis for private equity positions has been enhanced with the range of key unobservable inputs now quoted.\nFinancial\nstatements\nNotes on the financial statements\nThe range of values above shows the highest and lowest unobservable inputs that have been used to value significant Level 3 exposures and\nreflects the diversity of the underlying financial instruments in scope and subsequent differentiation in pricing.\nPrivate equity including strategic investments\nThe \u2018private equity\u2019 holdings include private equity investments and private equity funds held as limited partners. The key unobservable input is\nthe current value of the underlying positions, determined using valuation techniques in line with the International Capital Valuation Guidelines.\nThe inputs represented are an appropriate range of inputs normalised across different exposure types.\nPrepayment rates\nPrepayment rates are a measure of the anticipated future speed at which a loan portfolio will be repaid in advance of the due date. They vary\naccording to the nature of the loan portfolio and expectations of future market conditions, and may be estimated using a variety of evidence,\nsuch as prepayment rates implied from proxy observable security prices, current or historical prepayment rates and macroeconomic modelling.\nMarket proxy\nMarket proxy pricing may be used for an instrument when specific market pricing is not available but there is evidence from instruments with\ncommon characteristics. In some cases it might be possible to identify a specific proxy, but more generally evidence across a wider range of\ninstruments will be used to understand the factors that influence current market pricing and the manner of that influence.\nVolatility\nVolatility is a measure of the anticipated future variability of a market price. It varies by underlying reference market price, and by strike and\nmaturity of the option. Certain volatilities, typically those of a longer-dated nature, are unobservable and are estimated from observable data.\nThe range of unobservable volatilities reflects the wide variation in volatility inputs by reference market price.\nCorrelation\nCorrelation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two market variables and is expressed as a number between minus one and one. It\nis used to value more complex instruments where the payout is dependent upon more than one market variable. There is a wide range of\ninstruments for which correlation is an input, and consequently a wide range of both same-asset correlations and cross-asset correlations is\nused. In general, the range of same-asset correlations will be narrower than the range of cross-asset correlations.\nUnobservable correlations may be estimated based upon a range of evidence, including consensus pricing services, HSBC trade prices, proxy\ncorrelations and examination of historical price relationships. The range of unobservable correlations quoted in the table reflects the wide\nvariation in correlation inputs by market variable pair.\nCredit spread\nCredit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality. In a discounted cash flow\nmodel, the credit spread increases the discount factors applied to future cash flows, thereby reducing the value of an asset. Credit spreads may\nbe implied from market prices and may not be observable in more illiquid markets.\nInter-relationships between key unobservable inputs\nKey unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments may not be independent of each other. As described above, market variables may be\ncorrelated. This correlation typically reflects the manner in which different markets tend to react to macroeconomic or other events.\nFurthermore, the effect of changing market variables on the HSBC portfolio will depend on HSBC\u2019s net risk position in respect of each variable.\nHSBC Holdings\nBasis of valuing HSBC Holdings\u2019 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n2024 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total\n$m $m $m $m $m $m\nRecurring fair value measurement\nAssets at 31 Dec\nTrading assets 709 \u2014 709 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nFinancial assets with HSBC undertakings designated and\notherwise mandatorily measured at fair value \u2014 61,286 61,286 \u2014 59,879 59,879\nDerivatives \u2014 3,054 3,054 \u2014 3,344 3,344\nLiabilities at 31 Dec\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value \u2014 41,582 41,582 \u2014 43,638 43,638\nDerivatives \u2014 5,340 5,340 \u2014 6,090 6,090", "page_start": 393, "page_end": 394, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

Accordingly,\ntheir carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. They include cash and balances at central banks, Hong Kong Government\ncertificates of indebtedness and Hong Kong currency notes in circulation, all of which are measured at amortised cost.\nValuation\nFair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. This may be different from the theoretical economic value attributed from an instrument\u2019s cash\nflows over its expected future life. Our valuation methodologies and assumptions in determining fair values for which no observable market\nprices are available may differ from those of other companies.\nLoans and advances to banks and customers\nTo determine the fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics. Fair\nvalues are based on observable market transactions, when available. When they are unavailable, fair values are estimated using valuation\nmodels incorporating a range of input assumptions. These assumptions may include: value estimates from third-party brokers reflecting over-\nthe-counter trading activity; forward-looking discounted cash flow models, taking account of expected customer prepayment rates, using\nassumptions that HSBC believes are consistent with those that would be used by market participants in valuing such loans; recent origination\npricing for similar loans; and trading inputs from other market participants including observed primary and secondary trades. From time to time,\nwe may engage a third-party valuation specialist to measure the fair value of a pool of loans.\nThe fair value of loans reflects expected credit losses at the balance sheet date and estimates of market participants\u2019 expectations of credit\nlosses over the life of the loans, and the fair value effect of repricing between origination and the balance sheet date. For credit-impaired loans,\nfair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows over the time period they are expected to be recovered.\nFinancial investments\nThe fair values of listed financial investments are determined using bid market prices. The fair values of unlisted financial investments are\ndetermined using valuation techniques that incorporate the prices and future earnings streams of equivalent quoted securities.\nDeposits by banks and customer accounts\nThe fair values of on-demand deposits are approximated by their carrying amount.

Further details of how these risks arise\nand how they are managed by the Group can be found in the \u2018Risk review\u2019.\nHedged risk components\nHSBC designates a portion of cash flows of a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments for a specific interest rate or foreign\ncurrency risk component in a fair value or cash flow hedge. The designated risks and portions are either contractually specified or otherwise\nseparately identifiable components of the financial instrument that are reliably measurable. Risk-free or benchmark interest rates generally are\nregarded as being both separately identifiable and reliably measurable, except for the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 transition\nwhere HSBC designates alternative benchmark rates as the hedged risk which may not have been separately identifiable upon initial\ndesignation, provided HSBC reasonably expects it will meet the requirement within 24 months from the first designation date. The designated\nrisk components account for a significant portion of the overall changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items.\nHSBC uses net investment hedges to hedge the structural foreign exchange risk related to net investments in foreign operations including\nsubsidiaries and branches whose functional currencies are different from that of the parent. When hedging with foreign exchange forward\ncontracts, the spot rate component of the foreign exchange risk is designated for an amount of net assets as the hedged risk.\nSources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk, including but not limited to the discount rates used for calculating the fair value of\nderivatives, hedges using instruments with a non-zero fair value, and notional and timing differences between the hedged items and hedging\ninstruments.\nFair value hedges\nHSBC enters into fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in fair value caused by movements in market\ninterest rates on certain fixed-rate financial instruments that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, including debt securities held\nand issued.\nHSBC hedging instrument by hedged risk\nHedging instrument\nCarrying amount\nNotional amount1,2 Assets Liabilities Balance sheet Change in fair value3\nHedged risk $m $m $m presentation $m\nInterest rate4 190,332 4,180 4,411 Derivatives (449)\nAt 31 Dec 2024 190,332 4,180 4,411 (449)\nInterest rate4 172,985 3,729 2,965 Derivatives (1,043)\nAt 31 Dec 2023 172,985 3,729 2,965 (1,043)\n1 The notional contract amounts of derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships indicate the nominal value of transactions outstanding at\nthe balance sheet date.

The amounts and timing of future cash flows,\nrepresenting both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their contractual\nterms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The aggregate cash flows representing both principal\nbalances and interest cash flows across all portfolios are used to determine the effectiveness and ineffectiveness.

The Group\u2019s investment in BoCom is classified as\nan associate. Significant influence in BoCom was established with consideration of all relevant factors, including representation on BoCom\u2019s\nBoard of Directors and participation in a resource and experience sharing agreement (\u2018RES\u2019). Under the RES, HSBC staff have been seconded\nto assist in the maintenance of BoCom\u2019s financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method of\naccounting in accordance with IAS 28 \u2018Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\u2019, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost\nand adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Group\u2019s share of associate\u2019s net assets. An impairment test is required if there is\nany indication of impairment or reversal.\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying amount, which resulted in an impairment of $3.0bn, as the\nrecoverable amount as determined by a value in use (\u2018VIU\u2019) calculation was lower than the carrying amount. No further impairment was\nrequired for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nIf the Group did not have significant influence in BoCom, the investment would be carried at fair value rather than the current carrying amount.\nOn 24 September 2024, the People\u2019s Bank of China, National Financial Regulatory Administration and China Securities Regulatory Commission\nannounced several policies aimed at promoting growth and economic development. These included monetary stimulus, property market\nsupport and capital market strengthening measures, as well as measures to recapitalise the largest commercial banks. In the absence of\nfurther details on how the recapitalisation of the largest commercial banks may be enacted, there is no change to the impairment test result at\n31 December 2024. As further details become available, the impairment test will be updated to reflect their impact and may result in a change\nto the carrying value of our investment in BoCom. These developments have the potential to impact on the Group\u2018s reported earnings, but are\nunlikely to have an impact on HSBC's capital or capital ratios.\nWe remain supportive of our relationship with BoCom and will consider any broader implications on the carrying value of our investment as\nfurther details become available.\nImpairment testing\nAt 31 December 2024, the carrying amount of the investment was $22.4bn (2023: $21.2bn) with fair value of $11.6bn (2023: $8.8bn). The\nGroup has concluded there is no indication of further impairment (or indication that an impairment may no longer exist or may have decreased)\nsince 31 December 2023. As part of this assessment, the Group updated the VIU calculation which supported that there was no significant\nchange to the 31 December 2023 impairment position. As a result, no additional impairment to the carrying amount (or reversal of impairment)\nwas made at 31 December 2024.\nBasis of recoverable amount\nThe VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on management\u2019s best estimates of future earnings available to ordinary\nshareholders prepared in accordance with IAS 36 \u2019Impairment of Assets\u2019. Those cash flows used estimates based on BoCom\u2019s current\ncondition and so do not include estimated cash flows arising from uncommitted future actions that may affect the performance of the\ninvestment which will be considered at the relevant time should they arise. Significant management judgement is required in arriving at the\nbest estimate.\nThe VIU may increase or decrease depending on the effect of changes to model inputs. The main model inputs are described below and are\nbased on factors observed at period-end. The factors that could result in increases or reductions in the VIU include changes in BoCom\u2019s short-\nterm performance, a change in regulatory capital requirements or revisions to the forecast of BoCom\u2019s future profitability.\nThere are two main components to the VIU calculation. The first component is management\u2019s best estimate of BoCom\u2019s earnings. Forecast\nearnings growth over the short to medium term continues to be lower than recent (within the last five years) actual growth, and reflects the\nimpact of recent macroeconomic, policy and industry factors in mainland China. As a result of management\u2018s intent to continue to retain its\ninvestment for the long term, earnings beyond the short to medium term are extrapolated into perpetuity using a long-term growth rate to\nderive a terminal value, which comprises the majority of the VIU. The second component is the capital maintenance charge (\u2018CMC\u2019), which is\nmanagement\u2019s forecast of the earnings that need to be withheld in order for BoCom to meet capital requirements over the forecast period,\nmeaning that CMC is deducted when arriving at management\u2019s estimate of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders. The CMC\nreflects the revised capital requirements arising from revisions of the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets assumption. The principal\ninputs to the CMC calculation include estimates of asset growth, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets and the expected capital\nrequirements. An increase in the CMC as a result of a change to these principal inputs would reduce VIU. Additionally, management considers\nother qualitative factors, to ensure that the inputs to the VIU calculation remain appropriate.", "page_start": 403, "page_end": 404, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

Additionally, management considers\nother qualitative factors, to ensure that the inputs to the VIU calculation remain appropriate.\nKey assumptions in value in use calculation\nWe used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\u2013 Long-term profit growth rate: 3.00% (2023: 3.00%) for periods after 2028, which does not exceed forecast GDP growth in mainland China\nand is similar to forecasts by external analysts.\n\u2013 Long-term asset growth rate: 3.25% (2023: 3.00%) for periods after 2028, which is the rate that assets are expected to grow to achieve long-term\nprofit growth of 3.00%. The increase of long-term asset growth rate was supported by historical data, which is expected to continue.\n\u2013 Discount rate: 8.53% (2023: 9.00%), which is based on a capital asset pricing model (\u2018CAPM\u2019), using market data. The discount rate used is\nwithin the range of 7.1% to 8.8% (2023: 7.9% to 9.7%) indicated by the CAPM, and decreased as a consequence of a market-driven\nreduction in the risk-free rate.\n\u2013 Expected credit losses (\u2018ECL\u2019) as a percentage of loans and advances to customers: ranges from 0.74% to 0.93% (2023: 0.80% to 0.97%)\nin the short to medium term, reflecting reported credit experience in mainland China. For periods after 2028, the ratio is 0.97% (2023:\n0.97%), which is higher than BoCom\u2019s average ECL as a percentage of loans and advances to customers in recent years prior to the\nCovid-19 pandemic.\n\u2013 Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets: ranges from 62.0% to 62.5% (2023: 62.0% to 63.7%) in the short to medium term,\nreflecting higher risk-weights in the short term followed by an expected reversion to recent historical levels. For periods after 2028, the ratio\nis 62.0% (2023: 62.0%), which continues to be similar to BoCom\u2019s actual results in recent years.\n\u2013 Loans and advances to customers growth rate: ranges from 7.5% to 9.5% (2023: 9.0% to 10.0%) in the short to medium term, which is\nsimilar to BoCom\u2019s actual results in recent years. Changes in the forecast growth rate of loans and advances to customers are likewise\nreflected in the forecast ECL.\n\u2013 Operating income growth rate: ranges from 0.1% to 9.9% (2023: -0.4% to 9.7%) in the short to medium term, which is similar to BoCom\u2019s\nactual results in recent years, and is impacted by projections of net interest income in the short term as a consequence of recent\nmacroeconomic, policy and industry factors in mainland China.\n\u2013 Cost-income ratio: ranges from 34.6% to 39.8% (2023: 35.5% to 39.8%) in the short to medium term. These ratios are similar to BoCom\u2019s\nactual results in recent years.\n\u2013 Long-term effective tax rate: 15.0% (2023: 15.0%) for periods after 2028, which is higher than the recent historical average, and aligned to\nthe minimum tax rate as proposed by the OECD/Group of 20 (\u2018G20\u2019) Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.\n\u2013 Capital requirements: capital adequacy ratio of 12.5% (2023: 12.5%) and tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 9.5% (2023: 9.5%), based on\nBoCom\u2019s capital risk appetite and capital requirements respectively.\nThe changes in VIU would impact the carrying amount if there is an indication of further impairment (or indication that an impairment may no\nlonger exist or may have decreased, to the extent of impairment loss previously recognised). The following table illustrates the impact on the\ncarrying amount of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions used in the VIU calculation. This reflects the sensitivity of each key\nassumption on its own and it is possible that more than one favourable and/or unfavourable change may occur at the same time. The selected\nrates of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions are based on external analysts\u2019 forecasts, statutory requirements and other relevant\nexternal data sources, which can change period to period. Unless specified, favourable and unfavourable changes are consistently applied\nthroughout short-to-medium and long-term forecast years, based on a straight-line average of the base case assumption.\nSensitivity of the carrying amount to the key VIU assumptions\nFavourable change Unfavourable change\nReversal of impairment /\nVIU headroom Impairment\nbps $bn bps $bn\nAt 31 Dec 2024\nLong-term profit growth rate 55 4.0 (96) (5.4)\nLong-term asset growth rate (121) 8.6 30 (2.8)\nDiscount rate (143) 5.4 287 (6.4)\nExpected credit losses as a percentage of loans and advances to 2024 to 2028: 66 2024 to 2028: 108\ncustomers 2029 onwards: 91 4.0 2029 onwards: 104 (4.3)\nRisk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets (132) 0.8 234 (1.7)\nLoans and advances to customers growth rate (217) 3.4 340 (6.1)\nOperating income growth rate 76 2.7 (81) (3.3)\nCost-income ratio (190) 0.2 380 (7.1)\nLong-term effective tax rate (426) 1.6 1,000 (4.0)\nCapital requirements \u2013 capital adequacy ratio \u2014 \u2014 372 (14.3)\nCapital requirements \u2013 tier 1 capital adequacy ratio \u2014 \u2014 270 (6.7)\nAt 31 Dec 2023\nLong-term profit growth rate 58 3.3 (79) (3.4)\nLong-term asset growth rate (79) 4.5 58 (4.0)\nDiscount rate (110) 4.5 280 (6.1)\nExpected credit losses as a percentage of loans and advances to 2023 to 2027: 78 2023 to 2027: 120\ncustomers 2028 onwards: 91 2.9 2028 onwards: 104 (4.4)\nRisk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets (150) 0.9 216 (1.6)\nLoans and advances to customers growth rate (213) 3.2 207 (2.9)\nOperating income growth rate 57 2.6 (81) (2.6)\nCost-income ratio (212) 0.8 99 (2.9)\nLong-term effective tax rate (426) 1.6 1,000 (3.5)\nCapital requirements \u2013 capital adequacy ratio \u2014 \u2014 215 (7.5)\nCapital requirements \u2013 tier 1 capital adequacy ratio \u2014 \u2014 248 (3.7)\nFinancial\nstatements", "page_start": 404, "page_end": 405, "company": "HSBC", "ticker": "HSBA", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://www.hsbc.com/-/files/hsbc/investors/hsbc-results/2024/annual/pdfs/hsbc-holdings-plc/250219-annual-report-and-accounts-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/HSBC/2024/HSBC_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "HSBC_2024_annual_report"}

During 2024, we completed the sale of HSBC Bank Canada to the\nRoyal Bank of Canada, therefore it is no longer an indirect subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. There has been no material percentage change in HSBC\u2019s shareholding\nfor its existing main subsidiaries since 2023.\n2 In addition to the strategic holding disclosed above, the Group held 0.06% (2023: 0.09%) shareholding as part of its trading books.\n3 Based on the latest corporate substantial shareholding notice filed with Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited on 21 June 2024, the Group\u2019s shareholding in\nHang Seng Bank Limited on 18 June 2024 was 63.04%. Movements in our shareholding since 18 June 2024 are reflected in the above table.\nDetails of the debt, subordinated debt and preference shares issued by the main subsidiaries to parties external to the Group are included in\nNote 26 \u2018Debt securities in issue\u2019 and Note 29 \u2018Subordinated liabilities\u2019, respectively.\nA list of all related undertakings is set out in Note 38. The principal countries and territories of operation are the same as the countries and\nterritories of incorporation except for HSBC Life (International) Limited, which operates mainly in Hong Kong.\nHSBC is structured as a network of regional banks and locally incorporated regulated banking entities. Each bank is separately capitalised in\naccordance with applicable prudential requirements and maintains a capital buffer consistent with the Group\u2019s risk appetite for the relevant\ncountry or region. HSBC\u2019s capital management process is incorporated in the financial resource plan, which is approved by the Board.\nHSBC Holdings is the primary provider of equity capital to its subsidiaries and also provides them with non-equity capital where necessary.\nThese investments are substantially funded by HSBC Holdings\u2019 issuance of equity and non-equity capital, and by profit retention.\nAs part of its capital management process, HSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a balance between the composition of its capital and its\ninvestment in subsidiaries. Subject to this, there is no current or foreseen impediment to HSBC Holdings\u2019 ability to provide funding for such\ninvestments. During 2024, consistent with the Group\u2019s capital plan, the Group\u2019s material subsidiaries did not experience any significant\nrestrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned\ndividends or payments from material subsidiaries. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings\ndepends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and\nfinancial and operating performance.\nThe amount of guarantees by HSBC Holdings in favour of other Group entities is set out in Note 33.\nInformation on structured entities consolidated by HSBC where HSBC owns less than 50% of the voting rights is included in Note 20\n\u2018Structured entities\u2019. In each of these cases, HSBC controls and consolidates an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns\nfrom its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nImpairment testing of investments in subsidiaries\nAt each reporting period end, HSBC Holdings reviews investments in subsidiaries for indicators of impairment. An impairment is recognised\nwhen the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount for that investment. The recoverable amount is the higher of the investment\u2019s fair\nvalue less costs of disposal and its VIU, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36. The VIU is calculated by discounting management\u2019s\ncash flow projections for the investment. The cash flows represent the free cash flows based on the subsidiary\u2019s binding capital requirements.\nWe used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\u2013 Management\u2019s judgement in estimating future cash flows: The cash flow projections for each investment are based on the latest approved\nplans, which include forecast capital available for distribution based on the capital requirements of the subsidiary, taking into account\nminimum and core capital requirements and factoring in reasonably possible uncertainties. For the impairment test as at 31 December 2024,\ncash flow projections until the end of 2029 were considered in line with our internal planning horizon. Our cash flow projections include\nknown and observable climate-related opportunities and costs associated with our sustainable products and operating model.\n\u2013 Long-term growth rates: The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the free cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term\nperspective of the legal entity.

The growth rate reflects long-term inflation for the country or territory within which the investment operates.\nFinancial\nstatements\nNotes on the financial statements\n\u2013 Discount rates: The rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of capital assigned to each investment, which is derived using\na CAPM and market implied cost of equity. CAPM depends on a number of inputs reflecting financial and economic variables, including the\nrisk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are based on the market\u2019s\nassessment of the economic variables and management\u2019s judgement. The discount rates for each investment are refined to reflect the\nrates of inflation for the countries or territories within which the investment operates. In addition, for the purposes of testing investments\nfor impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM, with\ncost of capital rates produced by external sources for businesses operating in similar markets. The impacts from climate risk are included to\nthe extent that they are observable in discount rates and asset prices.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the carrying amount of HSBC Holdings\u2019 investments in subsidiaries was $152.3bn (2023: $159.5bn). The year-on-year\nreduction was predominantly due to the recognition of an $11.4bn impairment of HSBC Holdings\u2019 investment in HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK)\nLimited.\nThe recoverable amount of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited is assessed as the aggregate of the recoverable amounts of its subsidiaries.\nDuring the year HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited sold its stake in its direct subsidiary HSBC Bank Canada to Royal Bank of Canada, and\ntransferred HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, its indirect subsidiary (via HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA), to HSBC Bank plc.\nFollowing these disposals HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited paid $12.1bn in dividend income to HSBC Holdings, which mainly drove the\nrecognition of an $11.4bn impairment in its investment in HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited, offset by a higher recoverable amount of\nHSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited\u2019s principal remaining subsidiary as at 31 December 2024, HSBC North America Holdings Inc, driven by\nhigher projected profits and lower projected capital requirements.

It is currently funded entirely by commercial\npaper (\u2018CP\u2019) issued to HSBC. At 31 December 2024, HSBC held $1.0bn of CP (2023: $1.3bn).\nMulti-seller conduit\nHSBC\u2019s multi-seller conduit was established to provide access to flexible market-based sources of finance for its clients. Currently, HSBC bears\nrisk equal to the transaction-specific facility offered to the multi-seller conduit, amounting to $5.2bn at 31 December 2024 (2023: $6.1bn). First\nloss protection is provided by the originator of the assets, and not by HSBC, through transaction-specific credit enhancements. A layer of loss\nprotection is provided by HSBC in the form of a programme-wide enhancement facility.\nSecuritisations\nHSBC uses structured entities to securitise customer loans and advances it originates in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset\norigination and capital efficiency purposes. The loans and advances are transferred by HSBC to the structured entities for cash or synthetically,\nand the structured entities issue debt securities to investors.

The Group\u2019s CGUs do not carry on their balance sheets any significant intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, other\nthan goodwill.\nFinancial\nstatements\nNotes on the financial statements\nManagement\u2019s judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of goodwill in the next financial year,\nbut does consider this to be an area that is inherently judgemental. The cash flow projections for each CGU are based on forecast profitability\nplans approved by the Board and minimum capital levels required to support the business operations of a CGU. The Board challenges and\nendorses planning assumptions in light of internal capital allocation decisions necessary to support our strategy, current market conditions and\nmacroeconomic outlook. For the 1 October 2024 impairment test, cash flow projections until the end of 2029 were considered, in line with our\ninternal planning horizon. Key assumptions underlying cash flow projections reflect management\u2019s outlook on interest rates and inflation, as\nwell as business strategy, including the scale of investment in technology and automation. Our cash flow projections include known and\nobservable climate-related opportunities and costs associated with our sustainable products and operating model. As required by IFRS\nAccounting Standards, estimates of future cash flows exclude estimated cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring\ninitiatives before an entity has a constructive obligation to carry out the plan, and would therefore have recognised a provision for restructuring\ncosts.\nDiscount rate\nThe rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of equity assigned to each CGU, which is derived using a capital asset pricing\nmodel (\u2018CAPM\u2019) and market implied cost of equity. CAPM depends on a number of inputs reflecting financial and economic variables, including\nthe risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are based on the market\u2019s\nassessment of the economic variables and management\u2019s judgement. The discount rates for each CGU are refined to reflect the rates of\ninflation for the countries within which the CGU operates. In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, management\nsupplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM, with the cost of equity rates produced\nby external sources for businesses operating in similar markets. The impacts of climate risk are included to the extent that they are observable\nin discount rates and asset prices.\nLong-term growth rate\nThe long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective within the Group of\nbusiness units making up the CGUs. These growth rates reflect inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates or from which it\nderives revenue.\nSensitivities of key assumptions in calculating VIU\nAt 1 October 2024, given the extent by which VIU exceeds carrying amount, the HSBC UK WPB CGU was not sensitive to reasonably possible\nadverse changes in key assumptions supporting the recoverable amount. In making an estimate of reasonably possible changes to\nassumptions, management considers the available evidence in respect of each input to the VIU calculation, such as the external range of\ndiscount rates observable, historical performance against forecast and risks attaching to the key assumptions underlying cash flow projections.\nNone of the remaining CGUs are individually significant.\nOther intangible assets\nImpairment testing\nImpairment of other intangible assets is assessed in accordance with our policy explained in Note 1.2(n) by comparing the net carrying amount\nof CGUs containing intangible assets with their recoverable amounts. Recoverable amounts are determined by calculating an estimated VIU or\nfair value, as appropriate, for each CGU. No significant impairment was recognised during the year.\nKey assumptions in VIU calculation\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of other intangible assets in the next\nfinancial year, but does consider this to be an area that is inherently judgemental. We used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in\naccordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\u2013 Management\u2019s judgement in estimating future cash flows: We considered past business performance, current market conditions and our\nmacroeconomic outlook to estimate future earnings. As required by IFRS Accounting Standards, estimates of future cash flows exclude\nestimated cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring initiatives before an entity has a constructive obligation to\ncarry out the plan, and would therefore have recognised a provision for restructuring costs. For some businesses, this means that the\nbenefit of certain strategic actions may not be included in the impairment assessment, including capital releases. Our cash flow projections\ninclude known and observable climate-related opportunities and costs associated with our sustainable products and operating model.\n\u2013 Long-term growth rates: The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective\nof the businesses within the Group.\n\u2013 Discount rates: Rates are based on a combination of CAPM and market-implied calculations considering market data for the businesses and\ngeographies in which the Group operates. The impacts of climate risk are included to the extent that they are observable in discount rates\nand asset prices.\nSensitivity of estimates relating to non-financial assets\nAs explained in Note 1.2(a), estimates of future cash flows for CGUs are made in the review of goodwill and non-financial assets for\nimpairment. Non-financial assets include other intangible assets shown above, and owned property, plant and equipment and right-of-use\nassets (see Note 22). The most significant sources of estimation uncertainty are in respect of the goodwill balances disclosed above. There are\nno non-financial asset balances relating to individual CGUs which involve estimation uncertainty that represents a significant risk of resulting in\na material adjustment to the results and financial position of the Group within the next financial year.\nNon-financial assets are widely distributed across CGUs within the legal entities of the Group, including Corporate Centre assets that cannot be\nallocated to CGUs and are therefore tested for impairment at consolidated level. The recoverable amounts of other intangible assets, owned\nproperty, plant and equipment, and right-of-use assets cannot be lower than individual asset fair values less costs to dispose, where relevant.\nAt 31 December 2024 none of the CGUs were sensitive to reasonably possible adverse changes in key assumptions supporting the\nrecoverable amount.

The sale also included HSBC Continental Europe\u2019s 100% ownership interest in HSBC SFH (France) and its 3%\nownership interest in Cr\u00e9dit Logement.\nUpon completion and in accordance with the terms of the sale, HSBC Continental Europe received a \u20ac0.1bn ($0.1bn) profit participation interest\nin the ultimate holding company of My Money Group. The associated impacts on initial recognition of this stake at fair value were recognised as\npart of the pre-tax loss on disposal in 2023, upon the reclassification of the disposal group as held for sale. In accordance with the terms of the\nsale, HSBC Continental Europe retained a portfolio of \u20ac7.1bn ($7.4bn) at the time of the sale, consisting of home and certain other loans, and\nthe CCF brand, which it licensed to the buyer under a long-term licence agreement. Additionally, HSBC Continental Europe\u2019s subsidiaries,\nHSBC Assurances Vie (France) and HSBC Global Asset Management (France), entered into distribution agreements with the buyer.\nThe customer lending balances and associated income statement impacts of the portfolio of retained loans, together with the profit\nparticipation interest and the licence agreement of the CCF brand, were reclassified from WPB to Corporate Centre, with effect from 1 January\n2024.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we began the process of marketing the retained home and other loan portfolio for sale, which had a carrying\nvalue of \u20ac6.7bn ($6.9bn) at 31 December 2024. As a result, we reclassified the portfolio to a hold-to-collect-and-sell business model from\n1 January 2025 and will measure it prospectively from the first quarter of 2025 at fair value through other comprehensive income. We expect to\nrecognise an estimated $1bn fair value pre-tax loss in other comprehensive income on the remeasurement of the financial instruments. The\nvaluation of this portfolio of loans may be substantially different in the event of a sale due to entity and deal-specific factors, including funding\ncosts and the value of customer relationships. In the event of a sale, upon completion, the cumulative fair value changes recognised through\nother comprehensive income, which would reflect the terms of an agreed sale, would reclassify to the income statement.

Customer remediation is often initiated by HSBC in response to customer complaints and/or industry\ndevelopments in sales practices, and is not necessarily initiated by regulatory action.\nFor further details of the impact of IFRS 9 on undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees, presented in \u2018Contractual commitments\u2019,\nsee Note 33.

They qualified as additional tier 1 capital for\nHSBC under CRR II until 31 December 2021 by virtue of the application of grandfathering provisions. The capital securities guaranteed by HSBC\nBank plc also qualified as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC Bank plc (on a solo and a consolidated basis) under CRR II until 31 December 2021\nby virtue of the same grandfathering process. Since 31 December 2021, these securities have no longer qualified as regulatory capital for HSBC\nHoldings or HSBC Bank plc. On 31 October 2024, the capital securities guaranteed by HSBC Holdings were redeemed.\nAs at 31 December 2024 the preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc are intended to provide investors with rights to income and\ncapital distributions, as well as distributions upon liquidation of the issuer that are equivalent to the rights that they would have had if they had\npurchased non-cumulative perpetual preference shares of the issuer. There are limitations on the payment of distributions if such payments are\nprohibited under UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a payment would cause a breach of HSBC Bank plc\u2019s capital adequacy\nrequirements, or if HSBC Bank plc has insufficient distributable reserves (as defined).\nHSBC Bank plc have covenanted that, if prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions on the preferred securities in full, they\nwill not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of their ordinary shares, or repurchase or redeem their ordinary shares, until the\ndistribution on the preferred securities has been paid in full.\nIf the preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc are outstanding in November 2048, or if the total capital ratio of HSBC Bank plc (on a\nsolo or consolidated basis) falls below the regulatory minimum required, or if the Directors expect it to do so in the near term, provided that\nproceedings have not been commenced for the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of HSBC Bank plc, the holders\u2019 interests in the preferred\nsecurity guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc will be exchanged for interests in preference shares issued by HSBC Bank plc that have economic\nterms which are in all material respects equivalent to the preferred security and its guarantee.\nTier 2 securities\nTier 2 capital securities are either perpetual or dated subordinated securities on which there is an obligation to pay coupons. These capital\nsecurities are included within HSBC\u2019s regulatory capital base as tier 2 capital under CRR II, either as fully eligible capital or by virtue of the\napplication of grandfathering provisions. In accordance with CRR II, the capital contribution of all tier 2 securities is amortised for regulatory\npurposes in their final five years before maturity.\n30 Maturity analysis of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments\nThe table on page 418 provides an analysis of consolidated total assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments by residual contractual\nmaturity at the balance sheet date.

Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual contracts are included in the \u2018Due over 5 years\u2019 time bucket.\n\u2013 Non-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity are included in the \u2018Due over 5 years\u2019 time bucket.\n\u2013 Financial instruments included within assets and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale are classified on the basis of the contractual\nmaturity of the underlying instruments and not on the basis of the disposal transaction.\n\u2013 Liabilities under insurance contracts included in \u2018non-financial liabilities\u2019 are irrespective of contractual maturity included in the \u2018Due over 5\nyears\u2019 time bucket in the maturity table provided below.

Such commitments and guarantees are only issued after due consideration of HSBC Holdings\u2019 ability to finance the\ncommitments and guarantees and the likelihood of the need arising.\nHSBC Holdings actively manages the cash flows from its subsidiaries to optimise the amount of cash held at the holding company level.

Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments\nfrom material subsidiaries.

Dividends are paid quarterly at the sole and absolute discretion of the Board. The sterling preference share\ncarries no rights of conversion into ordinary shares of HSBC Holdings and no right to attend or vote at shareholder meetings of HSBC Holdings.\nThese securities can be redeemed by HSBC Holdings at any time, subject to prior approval by the PRA.\nOther equity instruments\nHSBC Holdings has included two types of additional tier 1 capital securities in its tier 1 capital, including the contingent convertible securities\ndescribed below. These are accounted for as equity because HSBC does not have an obligation to transfer cash or a variable number of its own\nordinary shares to holders under any circumstances outside its control. See Note 29 for additional tier 1 securities accounted for as liabilities.\nAdditional tier 1 capital \u2013 contingent convertible securities\nHSBC Holdings continues to issue contingent convertible securities that are included in its capital base as fully CRR II-compliant additional tier 1\ncapital securities on an end point basis. These securities are marketed principally and subsequently allotted to corporate investors and fund\nmanagers. The net proceeds of the issuances are typically used for HSBC Holdings\u2019 general corporate purposes and to further strengthen its\ncapital base to meet requirements under CRR II. These securities bear a fixed rate of interest until their initial call dates. After the initial call\ndates, if they are not redeemed, the securities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on credit\nspreads, fixed at issuance, above prevailing market rates. Interest on the contingent convertible securities will be due and payable only at the\nsole discretion of HSBC Holdings, and HSBC Holdings has sole and absolute discretion at all times to cancel for any reason (in whole or part)\nany interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any payment date. Distributions will not be paid if they are prohibited under UK\nbanking regulations or if the Group has insufficient reserves or fails to meet the solvency conditions defined in the securities\u2019 terms.\nThe contingent convertible securities are undated and are repayable at the option of HSBC Holdings in whole typically at the initial call date or\non any fifth anniversary after this date. In addition, the securities are repayable at the option of HSBC in whole for certain regulatory or tax\nreasons. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA. These securities rank pari passu with HSBC Holdings\u2019 sterling preference\nshares and therefore rank ahead of ordinary shares. The contingent convertible securities will be converted into fully paid ordinary shares of\nHSBC Holdings at a predetermined price, should HSBC\u2019s consolidated non-transitional CET1 ratio fall below 7.0%. Therefore, in accordance\nwith the terms of the securities, if the non-transitional CET1 ratio breaches the 7.0% trigger, the securities will convert into ordinary shares at\nfixed contractual conversion prices in the issuance currencies of the relevant securities, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.\nHSBC\u2019s additional tier 1 capital \u2013 contingent convertible securities in issue which are accounted for in equity\nOriginal nominal First call 2024 2023\namount (LCY) date $m $m\n$2,250m 6.375% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities1 Sept 2024 \u2014 2,250\n$2,450m 6.375% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities Mar 2025 2,450 2,450\n$3,000m 6.000% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities May 2027 3,000 3,000\n$1,800m 6.500% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities Mar 2028 1,800 1,800\n$1,500m 4.600% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities2 Dec 2030 1,500 1,500\n$1,000m 4.000% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities3 Mar 2026 1,000 1,000\n$1,000m 4.700% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities4 Mar 2031 1,000 1,000\n$2,000m 8.000% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities5 Mar 2028 1,980 1,980\n\u20ac1,250m 4.750% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities Jul 2029 1,422 1,422\n\u00a31,000m 5.875% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities Sept 2026 1,301 1,301\n$1,350m 6.875% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities6 Sept 2029 1,337 \u2014\n$1,150m 6.950% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities7 Mar 2034 1,138 \u2014\nSGD1,500m 5.250% Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities8 Jun 2029 1,096 \u2014\nAt 31 Dec 19,024 17,703\n1 This security was called by HSBC Holdings on 23 July 2024 and redeemed and cancelled on 17 September 2024.\n2 This security was issued by HSBC Holdings on 17 December 2020.

In 2024, we\ncontinued to incorporate certain aspects of sustainable finance within our financial planning process.\n\u2013 We do not fully disclose impacts from climate-related opportunities on financial planning and performance including on\nrevenue, costs and the balance sheet, quantitative scenario analysis, detailed climate risk exposures for all sectors and\ngeographies or physical risk metrics. This is due to transitional challenges in relation to data limitations, although nascent\nwork is ongoing in these areas.

In 2022, the absolute on-balance sheet financed emissions of our portfolio decreased by\n69% to 1.44 Mt COe relative to the re-baselined 2020 figure, and they rose by 4% from 2021 to 2022. The reduction\n2\nfrom the 2020 re-baselined figure was due to strategic decisions and temporary factors, such as low loan drawdown\nlevels.\nImpact on supply \u2013 In 2024 we incorporated an additional supply chain data source to complement data from CDP (formerly the Carbon Page 58\nchain and/or value Disclosure Project). We continue to improve the measurement, quality and reporting of our supply chain emissions data to\nchain generate insights to drive targeted reduction activities.\n\u2013 Our supply chain contributes c.81% of our operational emissions and is the area in which we face the most significant Page 58\ndecarbonisation challenge. Many suppliers are still in the early phase of their decarbonisation journey. We have stepped\nup targeted efforts to support decarbonisation across our supply chain.\n\u2013 We focus on building strategic partnerships that can help to create an enabling environment for mobilising finance, and Page 47\nsupport development and scaling-up of solutions for the net zero transition. In 2024 we donated approximately $9m in\ngrant funding to help establish a portfolio of partnerships aligned to the strategic focus areas set out in our net zero\ntransition plan: transitioning industry, catalysing the new economy, and decarbonising trade and supply chains.

This has been Page 58\nand mitigation achieved through optimising the use of our real estate portfolio and carrying out a reduction in our office space and data\nactivities centres. We continue to optimise our assets to ensure greater efficiency and capitalise on new energy technologies. In 2024\nwe increased our purchase of electricity from renewable sources to 75.4% from 58.4% in 2023. This included increasing our\ncoverage of green tariffs in India and mainland China. Renewable electricity can help unlock our emissions reduction\npotential, and we aim to achieve 100% renewable electricity across our own operations by 2030.\n\u2013 This forward-looking data along with historical data helps inform real estate planning. We will continue to enhance our Page 228\nunderstanding of how extreme weather events impact our buildings portfolio as climate risk assessment tools improve and\nevolve. We buy insurance for property damage and business interruption and consider insurance as a loss-mitigation\nstrategy depending on its availability and price. We regularly review and enhance our building selection process and global\nengineering standards and will continue to assess historical claims data to help ensure our building selection and design\nstandards address the potential impacts of climate change.\nImpact on operations \u2013 We measure the impacts of climate and weather events on our buildings on an ongoing basis using historical, current and Page 228\nscenario-modelled forecast data. In 2024, there were 40 major storms that had a minor impact on three of our buildings.\nWe use stress testing to evaluate the potential impact on our owned or leased premises. Our 2024 scenario stress test\nanalysed how nine climate change-related hazards \u2013 comprising coastal flooding, fluvial flooding, pluvial flooding, soil\nmovement due to drought, temperature extremes, water stress, wildfires, landslides and tropical cyclones \u2013 could impact\n2,719 of our properties.\nImpact on \u2013 Our five-year Climate Solutions Partnership with the World Resources Institute, WWF and over 50 local partners, Page 47\ninvestment in continues to support nature-based solutions and energy transition in Asia.

Our on-balance sheet financed emissions include emissions related to\nand financial on-balance sheet lending, such as project finance and direct lending. Our facilitated emissions include emissions related\nintermediary business to financing we help clients to raise through capital markets activities. Our analysis covers financing from Global Banking\n(supplemental guidance and Markets, and Commercial Banking.\nfor banks)\n\u2013 HSBC Asset Management recognises that climate-related risks may impact the operational and financial performance of Page 60\ninvestee companies. The impact of these risks will vary depending on characteristics such as asset class, sector,\nbusiness model and geography. HSBC Asset Management continues to integrate climate analysis into its actively\nmanaged product offerings and seeks to assess climate-related risks that could impact investment performance, where\napplicable and relevant.\n\u2013 We currently disclose partial scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. We currently focus on disclosing only four out of\nfifteen categories of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, including business travel, supply chain and financed\nemissions, following our internal materiality assessment. In relation to financed emissions, we publish on-balance\nsheet financed emissions for a number of sectors, covering 2.7% of our loans and advances to customers at\n31 December 2023, as detailed on page 56. We also publish facilitated emissions for the oil and gas, and power and\nutilities sectors. Data quality of future disclosures on financed emissions and related risks are reliant on our customers\npublicly disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, targets and plans, and related risks. We recognise the need to\nprovide early transparency on climate disclosures but balance this with the recognition that existing data and reporting\nprocesses continue to require significant enhancements.\nc) Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets (Companies Act\n2006 - Sections 414CA and 414CB 2A (g))\nDetails of targets set \u2013 We aim to help our customers transition to net zero and a sustainable future by providing and facilitating between Page 45\nand whether they are $750bn and $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030.\nabsolute or intensity\n\u2013 We set interim 2030 financed emissions targets. However, we use different time horizons for climate risk\nbased\nmanagement. For climate risk, we define short term as time periods up to 2026; medium term is between 2027 and\n2035; and long term is between 2036 and 2050. For financed emissions we do not plan to set 2026 targets. In 2024,\nwe disclose interim 2030 financed emissions targets for seven sectors comprising five on-balance sheet and two\ncombined financed emissions targets, as we outline on page 52. We have set combined on-balance sheet financed\nemissions and facilitated emissions targets for two emissions-intensive sectors: oil and gas; and power and utilities;\nand report the combined progress for both sectors. In 2025, we plan to review our targets to consider the latest net\nzero-aligned scenarios available. For further details on the restatements and targets and progress of financed\nemissions, see \u2019Our approach to emissions re-baselines and restatements\u2019 and \u2018Targets and progress\u2019 on pages 51\nand 52 respectively.\n\u2013 We do not currently disclose a target for capital deployment. In relation to capital deployment, since 2015, we have\nissued more than $2bn of our own green bonds and structured green bonds with the capital invested into a variety of\ngreen projects, including: green buildings; and renewable energy and clean transportation projects. Following\nextensive internal and external review of HSBC\u2019s green issuance framework, we published the updated HSBC Green\nFinancing Framework in October 2024. This Green Financing Framework forms part of our sustainability strategy and\nsets out our approach to allocating amounts equivalent to the net proceeds raised through certain instruments and\ntransactions against financing for businesses and projects that meet certain eligibility criteria. See the HSBC Green\nFinancing Framework at www.hsbc.com/investors/fixed-income-investors/green-financing-framework for further\ninformation.\n\u2013 We do not currently disclose an internal carbon pricing target due to transitional challenges, such as developing the\nappropriate systems and processes, but we considered carbon prices as an input for our climate scenario analysis\nexercise. We expect to further enhance the disclosure in the medium term as more data becomes available.\n\u2013 We do not currently disclose targets used to measure and manage physical risk. This is due to transitional challenges,\nincluding the data limitations of physical risk metrics. For retail, we do not use targets to measure and manage\nphysical risk. In 2024, we continued to use an internally developed global \u2018soft trigger\u2019 monitoring and review process\nfor physical risk exposure where a market reaches or exceeds a set threshold, as this ensures markets are actively\nconsidering their balance sheet risk exposure to peril events. We also consider physical and transition risk as an input\nfor our climate scenario analysis exercise. We expect to further enhance our disclosures as our data, quantitative\nscenario analysis, risk metrics and physical risk targets evolve, and technology solutions are implemented in the\nmedium term.\n\u2013 We have described the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and\nperformance against targets. However, taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider water\nusage to be a material target for our business and, therefore, we have not included a target in this year\u2019s disclosure.\nOther key performance \u2013 In 2024 we achieved a 30.5% reduction in our energy consumption compared with 2019 (2023: 26.3%).
