Our reporting year runs from 1 October 2023 to\n30 September 2024. The emissions reporting boundary is defined as all entities and facilities either owned or under our operational control.\nReporting(6)(7): emissions have been reported using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and associated guidance and include all greenhouse gases, reported in tonnes of\ncarbon dioxide equivalent (COe) and global warming potential values. When converting data to carbon emissions, we use Emission Factors from UK Government Emissions Conversion\n2\nFactors for Company Reporting (Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 2024), CO emissions from fuel combustion (International Energy Agency, 2023(8)) or relevant\n2\nlocal authorities as required. NatWest Group uses a third-party software system, to capture and record our environmental impact and ensure that control framework and assurance\nrequirements are met. All data is aggregated at a regional level to reflect the total regional consumption. The regional consumption results are then collated to reflect the total NatWest\nGroup footprint. COe values are attributed to these sources via an automatic conversion module in the third-party system.\n2\nFor more information, refer to the own operational footprint page at www.natwestgroup.com.\n(1) Offshore area as defined in The Companies (Directors Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon) Regulations 2018.

The remaining Scope 2 market-based emissions arise from district cooling, district heating and the residual amount of\nnon-renewable electricity.\n(5) Scope 3 emissions sources for our own operational emissions cover categories 1\u201314, with our direct own operations covering only paper, water, and categories 5\u20137. For more information, refer to page 23 of the NatWest Group 2024 Sustainability Report.\n(6) Low data accuracy is a key risk of our reporting, as this could lead to misreporting of own operations emissions figures. To combat this, we have robust internal controls processes, with data and claims subject to third-party assurance.\n(7) The historic values reported in the table above may be updated from values we reported in 2023.

For Mr Thwaite this includes travel assistance in connection with company business (\u00a363,154) and assistance with home security (\u00a32,924). For Ms Murray it includes travel assistance\nin connection with company business (\u00a312,824) and assistance with home security (\u00a32,924).\n(3) Pension: Executive directors receive a monthly pension allowance of 10% of base salary and can choose to participate in the company\u2019s pension arrangements. Mr Thwaite stopped being a member of the defined benefit pension scheme on\n28 February 2024. The value of the defined benefit pension for Mr Thwaite from 1 January to 28 February 2024 is based on the capitalised pension accrual (net of CPI inflation) during the period less the direct employee contribution (\u00a32,918).\nDue to Mr Thwaite\u2019s pensionable salary not increasing over this period and the CPI inflation figure required to be used in the calculation, the outcome of this calculation was negative \u00a378,280. As the aggregate value of these elements is negative,\nin line with regulations, the amount included in the single figure for 1 January to 28 February 2024 is zero. Full details of the defined benefit pension scheme can be found in the 2023 Directors\u2019 remuneration report.\n(4) Annual bonus: In determining bonus awards for 2024, the committee assessed performance against financial, strategic and personal measures as set out below and on the next page.\n(5) Long-term incentive: The 2024 value relates to LTI awards granted in 2022. The committee assessed performance prior to vesting and also considered whether the outcome could represent a windfall gain, as set out on pages 149 and 150.\n(6) Other benefits: The 2024 value relates to the first Sharing in Success award delivered in NatWest Group shares in May 2024 to all colleagues (including executive directors).

Of which, 5.4% were rated as high flood risk and 1.0% as very high flood risk (2023 \u2013 5.74% high flood risk\nand 1.1% very high flood risk). 63% of the exposure is in the Greater London region.\n(3) Flood risk is modelled by calculating an estimated loss for each flood source different types of flooding (fluvial, pluvial, tidal), annualised for each source and combined for a total flood score. Flood defences were considered where available. Flood scores\nwere allocated per property based on the potential annualised loss (\u00a3) to a property dependent on the type, frequency and depth of flooding modelled across different return periods. The scoring ranged from 0 to 100, with 0 being lowest and 100 being\nthe highest risk.

The table demonstrates the maturity transformation role being performed by NatWest Group\nof lending long-term whilst relying largely on short-term funding. This is possible as the behavioural profiles of many customer deposits, which tend to be repayable on demand, show\nlonger maturity and greater stability than their contractual agreements.\nNatWest Group forms expectations on customer behaviours through both qualitative and quantitative techniques, incorporating observed customer behaviours over historic time\nperiods, which includes the more recent periods of interest rate change.

The top-up tax relates to the Group\u2019s operations in Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man and Gibraltar\nwhere the statutory tax rate is below 15%. The Group recognised a current tax expense of \u00a320 million related to the top-up tax (2023 - \u00a30 million) which is levied on NatWest Group\nplc.\nThe Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.\nIn October 2024, Jersey enacted new tax legislation to implement a domestic minimum top-up tax, which is effective from 1 January 2025. As a result, from 2025, The Royal Bank of\nScotland International Limited will be liable for the top-up tax in relation to its operations instead of NatWest Group plc.\nJJuuddggeemmeenntt:: ttaaxx ccoonnttiinnggeenncciieess\nNatWest Group\u2019s corporate income tax charge and its provisions for corporate income taxes necessarily involve a degree of estimation and judgement.
