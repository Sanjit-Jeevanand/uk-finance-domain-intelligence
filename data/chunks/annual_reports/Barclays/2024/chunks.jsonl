In 2024 we focused on improving our\ncustomer and client propositions and the precision in our execution. The strength of our business is reflected in our financial performance.\nOur customers are at the heart of everything we do and in 2024 we have endeavoured to uplift the customer experience. While we have\nmore to do, we have seen meaningful improvements. Our targeted actions have led to a 36% reduction in customer complaints, an\nimprovement in customer satisfaction during phone call interactions, as well as increases in digital and Premier Net Promoter Scores\n(NPS)1.\nOptimising our footprint is important in delivering for our customers and clients. We have over 200 traditional, full-service branches across\nthe UK which we are investing in, for example, a complete refresh of our self-service devices is underway. We are also working closely with\nour peers to deliver more shared banking hubs, enabling us to provide banking and cash services in areas not covered by our branch\nnetwork. We have opened 103 hubs in communities across the UK, as part of a joint commitment to open at least 350 within the next five\nyears.\nOur customers and clients expect us to provide seamless, fast and reliable banking 24/7. The Barclays app has nearly five billion logins a\nyear, and in 2024 we\u2019ve made progress in service and technology improvements. We\u2019ve improved the app's features - including an\nenhanced search function, the ability to increase daily payment limits, the ability to access cash from ATMs without a card, and\nenhancements to our automated digital assistant.\nOur customers want a broader proposition and we\u2019ve improved our products and offerings. For example, we\u2019ve added Apple TV+ to the\nbenefits included in Blue Rewards and given Premier customers access to all Barclays Blue Rewards features.\nWe\u2019ve supported over 100,000 homebuyers and owners with their mortgage applications in 2024. A new Mortgage Charter journey has\nenabled customers experiencing short-term payment difficulties to temporarily reduce their payments via the Barclays app, simplifying the\nexperience and helping them to make informed decisions. Our subsidiary, Kensington Mortgages, launched a new Step Down mortgage\nwhere payments reduce after two years, helping customers facing financial changes. Kensington is currently the only mortgage provider in\nthe UK to offer this.\nThrough our Business Banking business, in 2024 we lent \u00a32.17bn to SMEs to help them grow. We have also migrated 650,000 business\nclients from legacy infrastructure and pricing onto a new standard current account tariff that provides streamlined, competitive pricing for\nall.\nIn November 2024, we completed the acquisition of Tesco Bank, which includes credit cards, unsecured personal loans, savings and\noperating infrastructure. Barclays Bank UK Group has also entered a long-term, exclusive partnership with Tesco Stores Limited for an\ninitial period of 10 years to market and distribute credit cards, unsecured personal loans and deposits using the Tesco brand, as well as to\nexplore other opportunities to offer financial services to Tesco customers. This builds on Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s existing strategic\npartnerships with other leading brands.\nAmazon co-branded credit card\nBarclays has launched a co-branded credit card with Amazon that lets customers earn rewards on everyday spending both with Amazon\nand with other retailers. The card has no annual fee and customers receive a \u00a320 Amazon gift card upon approval.\nThe Amazon Barclaycard will help the bank further achieve its lending ambitions. It is the only co-branded consumer credit card that\nAmazon offers in the UK and is the latest in a series of successful collaborations between Amazon and Barclays \u2013 including Instalments by\nBarclays, a reusable credit line that lets Amazon customers in the UK spread the cost of purchases over time.\nBusiness Banking lending\nResearch from Barclays2 revealed that business owners value convenience, speed and digital access to lending decisions, with the majority\nstating they prefer to use online banking to apply. In response, our Business Banking team is making funding more accessible. For example,\npreviously, only clients with pre-assessed limits who were applying for less than \u00a3100,000 could apply online; everyone else had to contact\nBarclays by phone or in person.

These risks are managed as part of\nour business model.\nEnterprise Risk Management Framework\nWithin the Barclays Bank UK Group, risks are identified and overseen in accordance with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework\n(ERMF), which supports the business in its aim to embed effective risk management and a strong risk management culture.\nThe ERMF governs the way in which the Barclays Bank UK Group identifies and manages its risks. The ERMF is approved by the Barclays\nPLC Board on the recommendation of the Barclays Group Chief Risk Officer; it is then adopted by the Barclays Bank UK Group with minor\nmodifications where needed.\nThe management of risk is then embedded into each level of the business, with all colleagues being responsible for identifying and\ncontrolling risk.\nIn 2024, financial crime risk was elevated to a principal risk in the ERMF, effective from 1 January 2025. Previously, financial crime risk was\nmanaged as part of compliance risk. Recognising the increased external threat of financial crime, this change will enhance transparency\nand visibility of financial crime risk within the Barclays Bank UK Group and reinforce independent assessment, management and oversight\nof financial crime risk.\nOn 1 November 2024, the Barclays Bank UK Group completed the acquisition of Tesco Bank. Following the acquisition, the acquired Tesco\nBank business continues to operate largely within its own risk framework, with dispensations in place for material divergences from\nexisting Barclays Bank UK Group policy requirements. Any subsequent changes to the Tesco Bank approach will be part of integration\nplanning activity.\nRisk appetite\nRisk appetite defines the level of risk we are prepared to accept across the different risk types, taking into consideration varying levels of\nfinancial and operational stress. Risk appetite is key to our decision-making processes, including ongoing business planning and setting of\nstrategy, new product approvals and business change initiatives.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group may choose to adopt a lower risk appetite than allocated to it by the Barclays Group but cannot approve a\nhigher risk appetite limit than determined by the Barclays PLC Board without its approval.\nThree lines of defence\nThe first line of defence comprises the revenue-generating and client-facing areas, along with all associated support functions, including\nFinance, Treasury, Human Resources and Operations and Technology. The first line identifies the risks, sets the controls and escalates risk\nevents to the second line of defence. Employees in the first line have primary responsibility for their risks and their activities are subject to\noversight from the relevant parts of the second and third lines.\nThe second line of defence is made up of Risk and Compliance and oversees the first line by setting limits, rules and constraints on their\noperations, consistent with the risk appetite.\nThe third line of defence comprises Internal Audit, and provides independent assurance to the Barclays Bank UK PLC Board and the\nBarclays Bank UK PLC Executive Committee on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control over current, systemic and\nevolving risks.\nThe Legal function provides support to all areas of the Barclays Bank UK Group and is not formally part of any of the three lines of defence.\nThe Legal function is responsible for proactively identifying, communicating and providing legal advice on applicable laws, rules and\nregulations. Except in relation to the legal advice it provides or procures, it is subject to second line oversight with respect to its own\noperational and compliance risks, as well as with respect to the legal risk to which the Barclays Bank UK Group is exposed.\nMonitoring the risk profile\nTogether with a strong governance process, using business and the Barclays Group level Risk Committees as well as Board level forums,\nthe Barclays Bank UK PLC Board receives regular information in respect of the risk profile of the Barclays Bank UK Group. Information\nreceived includes measures of risk profile against risk appetite as well as the identification of new and emerging risks, which are derived by\nmapping risk drivers, identified through horizon scanning, to risk themes, and similar analysis. For further details of monitoring risks please\nrefer to page 43\nDuring 2024, the Barclays Bank UK Group ran a macroeconomic internal stress test to assess its capital adequacy and resilience under a\nsevere but plausible macroeconomic scenario. This stress test targeted risks such as inflation, financial stress and a shock on demand; with\nterminal low rates set to test the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s vulnerabilities through NII (Net Interest Income) margin compression.

These panels provide regular insights to bring us closer to our customers and\ninform the evolution of our customer journeys, and to identify new opportunities to serve them, based on emerging trends.\nIn 2024, we collected over 1.2 million additional pieces of customer feedback. Customers told us they wanted their experiences with\nBarclays to feel more personal, and showed continued demand for increased convenience and functionality from the Barclays app.\nIn response we have enhanced the app to ensure every new or updated customer experience feels personalised .

We introduced SMS alerts to keep customers up to date during their ISA application, as well as introducing self-service elements to\nthe process such as transferring money into their ISA via their channel of choice.

This includes meeting\nwith customers and clients, colleagues, regulators, and other stakeholders. This engagement, both directly and through reporting by\nexecutive management, to whom the day-to-day operations of the business are delegated, seeks to ensure the Board understands the key\nissues to enable the Directors to comply with their legal duty under Section 172(1).\nFor more information on the Company\u2019s key stakeholder groups and how we listen and respond to them, please refer to the \u201cCustomer &\nClients\u201d, \u201cOur colleagues\u201d and \u201cSociety\u201d sections of the Strategic Report.

The Barclays Group also set financial targets to\nmatch this ambition and improve outcomes for all stakeholders. This strategy is reinforced by the redefined purpose: \u201cWorking together for\na better financial future\u201d which emphasises that the way we operate has a strong connection to the Barclays Group\u2019s values. For customers\nthat means helping improve livelihoods. For clients it\u2019s growth and scaling business. For communities, it represents upliftment, fulfilling\npotential beyond circumstance. And for colleagues, it provides a clear direction on why we exist and how we behave.\nAhead of the Barclays Group\u2019s announcement, and in line with the Board\u2019s responsibility to establish a strategy for both the Company and\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group, in 2023 the Board provided significant input into and oversight of the shaping of the Barclays Bank UK Group\nelements of the Barclays Group strategy, including the focus areas and related financial targets. As explained in the Strategic Report, for\nBarclays UK, a \u201cSimpler, Better and More Balanced\u201d retail bank means delivering operational efficiencies to facilitate investment in growth,\nimproving customer experience and product offering, and growing lending market share, particularly in business banking as well as\nsecured and unsecured lending.\nAligned to the focus areas, and throughout the year, the Board received updates from the heads of each business and operations who\npresented on strategy execution and performance against agreed targets. The Board Audit Committee considered the associated financial\nreporting and operation of internal controls, while the Board Risk Committee received first and second line reporting to ensure close\noversight of the respective risks. This has facilitated greater accountability at a business level and has supported closer monitoring, and\nmeasurement, of success.\nIn support of a \u201cMore Balanced\u201d retail bank, in late 2023, the Board first considered the opportunity to acquire Tesco Bank\u2019s retail banking\nbusiness and to enter into a long-term, exclusive partnership with Tesco Stores Limited for an initial period of 10 years to market and\ndistribute credit cards, unsecured personal loans and deposits using the Tesco brand and to explore opportunities to offer financial services\nto Tesco customers. Key factors in the Board\u2019s deliberations included: the alignment of the opportunity with the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s\nstrategy to grow lending market share; the demands that the acquisition, integration activity and management of the partnership would\nplace on the business \u2013 including colleagues \u2013 in the short to medium-term; the impact of the acquisition on Tesco Bank colleagues and\ncustomers; and whether the acquisition and the partnership would promote the success of the Company thereby creating and delivering\nlong-term, sustainable value for its sole shareholder, Barclays, and \u2013 in turn \u2013 Barclays\u2019 shareholders.\nOn 9 February 2024, the acquisition and the partnership were announced; completion occurred on 1 November 2024. Throughout the\nperiod between signing and completion, the Board and Board Committees exercised regular and robust oversight over preparation for\ncompletion and readiness for \u201cday one\u201d, including but not limited to the approach to migration, with a particular focus on ensuring a\nsmooth transition for Tesco Bank colleagues and customers.\nPost-completion, the Board, Board Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee have continued to receive regular updates on the Tesco\nBank business, including but not limited to accounting considerations (including fair value of assets and liabilities acquired), the control\nenvironment, risk mitigation, and future plans for the business and the partnership.

In response to the conflict in\nthe Middle East, the Barclays Group was subject to ongoing criticism and protest activity, including hundreds of attacks to bank branches\nacross the UK that resulted in significant damage. The Board, which was deeply concerned about the safety of colleagues and the\ndisruption created for customers, oversaw the response to the attacks with the support of the Board Risk Committee. This included, but\nwas not limited to, certain Board and Executive Committee members engaging with colleagues who were at the forefront to understand\nthe impact of the attacks (for example, by visiting affected branches) and putting in place additional measures to ensure the security of\ncolleagues and customers.\nConsumer Duty\nBank UK Group. This outcomes-based regulation is designed to ensure relevant financial services firms deliver good outcomes for retail\ncustomers. During 2024, the Board and the Board Risk Committee have overseen the continued embedment of the Consumer Duty for in-\nscope products and services as well as planning and readiness for the second implementation deadline of 31 July 2024 for closed products\nand services (being those products and services that have not been marketed or distributed to customers after 31 July 2023). This has\nincluded enhancing fair value assessments in accordance with FCA insights, monitoring customer outcomes via Consumer Duty reporting\nand the quarterly Customer Outcomes Report, and receiving risks and issues reporting.\nThe Barclays Bank UK PLC Board Consumer Duty Champion (a nominated Board member) was closely engaged in producing the first\nAnnual Consumer Duty Board Report, which assessed whether the business was delivering good outcomes for retail customers. In July\n2024, the Board - supported by its Consumer Duty Champion - considered and approved the Report, concluding that the strategy, purpose\nand ambition of the Barclays Bank UK Group is aligned with the Consumer Duty.\nThe Board remains committed to ensuring good customer outcomes and will continue to focus on Consumer Duty embedment during\n2025, giving consideration to the impact of any regulatory developments in relation to Consumer Duty.\nSir John Kingman\nChair \u2013 Barclays Bank UK PLC\n12 February 2025\nClimate and Sustainability report\nEmbedding Barclays\u2019 climate strategy within Barclays Bank UK\nreferences to Barclays UK referring to the businesses of Barclays Bank UK PLC and its subsidiaries. The content has been included to the\nextent this is relates to Barclays Bank UK as a subsidiary of the Barclays Group. For full details on targets and ambitions, refer to the Climate\nsustainability.\nClimate related risks\nThe Barclays climate strategy is underpinned by the way it assesses and manages exposure to climate-related risk. Climate risk is a\nPrincipal Risk within the Barclays Enterprise Risk Management Framework.\nBarclays faces exposure to climate-related risks either directly through its operations and infrastructure or indirectly through its financing\nand investment activities. The two main categories of climate risk are physical risks and transition risks.\n- Physical risk is defined as the risk of financial losses related to physical impacts of a changing climate. Physical risks can be event driven\n(acute risks), including increased frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes and flood. Longer term\nshifts in climate patterns (chronic risks) arise from sustained higher temperatures that may cause rises in sea levels, rising mean\ntemperatures and more severe weather events such as increased occurrence of floods or fires.\n- Transition risk is defined as the risk of financial losses caused by extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes to address\nmitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change.\nPhysical and transition risks can have varying degrees of impact on Barclays and its clients, influenced by geographic and jurisdictional\nfactors, including differing vulnerabilities to physical hazards like flooding and hurricanes as well as diverse regulatory requirements that\nmust be adhered to for transitioning to a low-carbon economy.\nClimate change as a driver of risk\nThe feedback effects of climate risk drivers through macro and micro transmission channels are observed in Barclays' portfolio through\ntraditional risk categories such as credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, operational risk and reputational risk. The approach for\nmanaging climate-related risks is consistent with other key risks, however there remains significant uncertainty around when these risks\nwill materialise.\nBarclays has implemented a risk management framework for Climate Risk which integrates within the broader Enterprise Risk Management\nFramework aiming to guide effective management of climate risk and support the delivery of its climate strategy. Barclays' approach and\nframework undergoes regular reviews and updates \u2013 including changes to the risk taxonomy, definitions and methodology \u2013 to align with\nchanging regulatory expectations and external developments.\nThe potential impacts of physical and transition risk drivers will vary across Barclays' portfolios depending on composition, industry,\ngeographic location, business operations and other contextual factors.\nProgress against targets, convergence points and ambitions\nUK Housing\nDuring 2024, we further expanded the scope of UK Housing to include our Kensington Mortgage Company Limited book. Our UK Housing\nportfolio\u2019s emissions intensity decreased by 1% during this period. This reflects the dependence of the decarbonisation of UK Housing on\nexternal changes and public policy interventions. Without these external changes, Barclays cannot materially decrease the emissions\nintensity of its UK Housing portfolio, which is why we continue to measure our progress against a 2030 emissions intensity 'convergence\npoint', but not set a formal target at this time. We have made strong progress against our EPC ambition for 55% of in scope properties and\ncollateral with a known EPC to be rated band C or better by 2030, achieving 49.7% by the end of 2024.\nUK Agriculture\nAn improvement in data quality, achieved through the integration of farm-level data, has allowed us to enhance the Dairy & Livestock\nBlueTrackTM model, now as an asset-based emissions model (see BlueTrackTM financed emissions methodology). Over time, this will enable\nus to better assess the impact of on-farm emissions reduction measures and where our clients are making positive change. We have re-\nbaselined our 2023 Agriculture model on this basis. This does not impact the existing 21% reduction target from 2023-2030.\nIn 2024, our UK Agriculture portfolio absolute financed emissions have reduced by 11%. This reflects the alignment of our financing\nactivity towards clients with lower emissions profiles and those taking positive action towards reducing on-farm emissions. We also\nconsider impacts from changes in client company value, which can fluctuate year to year and is reported at a delay due to the size of clients\nin this portfolio.\nHowever, we continue to face challenges to calculating emissions in the sector, notably a lack of data on the activities and practices of our\nagricultural customers, and modelling challenges around agricultural emissions intensity. To help advance approaches to Agriculture\nfinanced emissions measurement, and target setting in the banking sector more broadly, Barclays is a member of the Banking for Impact\non Climate in Agriculture (B4ICA) working group. We are also engaged in a three-year collaboration with Oxford University to develop food\ntype production datasets for the UK, with the aim of quantifying Barclays-financed emissions in more detail and consider additional\ntransition risks.", "page_start": 16, "page_end": 18, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

We have continued to enhance our suite of\nsustainability-related products and propositions to support Barclays UK customers to make more sustainable choices. We are focused on\ndriving performance of these products and propositions via customer insights, targeted marketing, and enhanced sustainability skill sets\nwithin Consumer and Business Banking teams, integrating much of the day-to-day operations of sustainability within the business.\nHowever, we also recognise dependency on external factors, such as public policy and supply chain readiness, to drive customer demand.\nWe remain committed to supporting our customers to transition to net zero and growing our sustainable finance business in the UK,\naligned with Barclays\u2019 three-year plan to grow its UK market.\nIn Barclays UK, we have grown our Sustainability Champions community, bringing together colleagues to share best practice regarding\nsustainability across the business and access specialist training. We launched a Sustainability Influencer program, with selected colleagues\nchampioning sustainability within their teams, to further embed sustainability in Barclays UK. In 2024 we also delivered a Barclays UK\nspecific training module to over 16,000 colleagues, delivered bespoke senior leader training, delivered role-specific training to colleagues in\nBusiness Banking, and launched our inaugural Sustainability Apprenticeships cohort in 2024, made up of colleagues from across Barclays\nUK who are obtaining a level 4 course with an external provider which aims to educate people to understand and develop ways to support\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy.\nConsumer Bank\nSustainability Hub\nBarclays UK continues to engage consumers through our online Consumer Sustainability Hub, which provides information on our financial\nproducts, services, informative content and partner offers that may support them in making more sustainable choices. In 2025, we will\nlaunch our in-app Sustainability Hub for current account customers, in order to drive greater engagement and visibility of our products,\nservices and partner offers, to better support our active mobile app customers.\nGreener Homes\nAn important driver to decarbonise the UK Housing sector is improved energy efficiency of the housing stock. We support our retail\nmortgage customers to retrofit their properties and reduce their energy consumption by providing financial products, services, and partner\noffers.\nWe continue to support customers purchasing EPC A- and B-rated new-build homes with our Green Home Mortgage, launched in 2018\nand expanded to buy-to-let in 2022. Our Green Home Mortgage continues to perform strongly, with \u00a31.1bn lent to Green Home Mortgage\ncustomers in 2024. Since inception, Barclays UK has lent over \u00a34.7bn to Green Home Mortgage customers.\nWe also continue to support eligible residential mortgage customers to install eligible energy-efficiency-related measures in their homes,\noffering a cash reward of up to \u00a32,000 via our Greener Home Reward offer. In 2024 we simplified the registration process and will expand\nthe scheme to include MCS accredited installers in 2025. Microgeneration continues to be the most popular installation since launch, with\n63% of reward payments for solar panels and solar battery storage, followed by low carbon heating at 20%.\nIn 2024, we piloted our Greener Home Loan, offering a cashback of up to \u00a3250 for eligible current account customers who take out a loan\nand use the money for energy-efficiency home improvements. We continue to monitor take-up and retrofit type, with solar being the most\npopular installation with 62% of claims.\nPartnerships Offers\nWe continue to develop our partnership offers to support customers home energy efficiency measures. This includes our offer of 50% off\nthe purchase of a Home Health Check for eligible residential mortgage customers in collaboration with British Gas, and our offer of a 6-\nmonth free trial of the Hugo Pro for eligible residential mortgage customers in collaboration with Hugo Energy to provide insights into\nhome energy usage. We also offer a free to use home energy tool through Energy Saving Trust, which supports residential mortgage\ncustomers to understand how energy efficient their homes are and improvements they could make.\nBusiness Bank\nEmbedding sustainability across the Business Bank\nWe continue to evolve our colleague training around sustainability, to better support our Business Bank clients. In 2024, 94% of our\nRelationship Managers completed sustainability related training, including modules on EPC ratings and green assets that are in scope of\nour green lending offering. In addition, our Net Zero Specialists team, established in 2023, continue to support clients to explore the steps\nthey can take to support their decarbonisation journey.\nSMEs\nBusiness Bank is supporting SMEs to invest in low carbon technologies as they transition to net zero. Our Green Loans for Business offer\ndiscounted interest rates when customers finance eligible green assets. In 2024, we expanded our Green Loans for Business with several\nadditional eligible loan products; namely, our Green Commercial Mortgage, Green Buy-to-Let Mortgage, SIPP & SSAS Green Property\nLoans, and Green Agricultural Mortgage. We have also updated our Eligible Green Asset Guide, which lists over 65 eligible green assets for\nour Green Loans for Business, to improve client access to our green financing options.

SMEs will often start by\nmaking changes directly within their control. Recognising this, in 2024, we launched a pilot with SaveMoneyCutCarbon to help clients\nexplore energy, water and carbon saving opportunities, with the aim of helping them transition to net zero in a cost-effective manner.\nExternal engagement\nWe recognise the opportunity to support the transition to net zero for SMEs via external engagement with policy makers and industry\nbodies. In 2024, Barclays became a co-chair of the Willow Review, an independent Government-backed review aiming to underline the\nfinancial benefits of sustainability for small businesses across the UK. We also became a member of Perseus, which aims to allow individual\nbusinesses to securely share their consumption data to create sustainability reports with personalised recommendations. We remain a\nmember of the UK Business Climate Hub advisory board, through which we were a partner in the UK Net Zero Business census released in\nSeptember 2024.\nClimate Tech\nWe set-up the Barclays Climate Tech Escalator in 2024, a connected pathway dedicated to growing climate tech companies. The Climate\nTech Escalator supports scaling by providing tailored, dedicated support as the companies grow and helps them to harness the power of\ncapital markets. We established a Technology & Creatives vertical in our Business Bank, which provides financial services to early-stage\nclimate tech companies. Through Eagle Labs we support these companies with mentorship, webinars, workshops, and provide programs\nsuch as the Carbon13 Venture Launchpad and UK Government funded Sustainability Bridge to help them scale.\nWe recognise the funding challenge inhibiting the success of growth-stage climate tech companies, particularly those at the Series B+\ninvestment stage. In 2024, Barclays published a paper on the role of UK public finance to bridge the financing gap for growth-stage climate\ntech companies, as well as the common challenges they face. In 2025 we will explore new products which can help address these financing\ngaps.\nAgriculture\nIn 2024, we launched a Green Agricultural Mortgage to support UK farming clients to undertake more sustainable practices and implement\nenergy-efficiency improvements. We continue to engage with farmers to explore the challenges and opportunities that may emerge from\nthe decarbonisation of the Agricultural sector. In 2024 we undertook two surveys of our UK farming clients to better understand the\nchallenges they face in progressing towards net zero, and published a policy position paper on the opportunity of biodiversity net gain\n(BNG).\nIn October 2024, Barclays launched a first of its kind collaboration with the Environment Bank. This collaboration aims to help Barclays\u2019 UK\nfarming clients in England understand opportunities in the Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) market. It also aims to help Barclays UK Corporate\nBank clients, including UK-based housebuilders that are seeking to fulfil their BNG scheme obligations, to explore opportunities and their\noptions in the biodiversity credits market. Recognising Barclays\u2019 market presence in the Agriculture and Housing sectors, this collaboration\nsupports clients across Barclays UK and UK Corporate Bank to explore new revenue opportunities emerging from the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy.\nBarclays Eagle Labs\nBarclays Eagle Labs look to help incubate, inspire and educate UK founders, start-ups and scale-ups to help them succeed and grow\nthrough virtual support and a network of 42 physical sites across the UK. In 2024 Eagle Labs has expanded into nine new locations and has\nsupported over 4,439 businesses through propositions, programmes, and businesses engaged with our network. Eagle Labs also launched\nan online learning platform to help support founders with the knowledge and skills needed to launch and grow a tech business as part of\nthe Digital Growth Grant activity funded by UK Government. In 2024 Eagle Labs opened applications for 22 growth programmes including\nthe Black Founders Accelerator programme designed to champion inclusion in entrepreneurship and showcase Black Founder-led\nbusinesses.\nCambridge Eagle Lab was relaunched in October 2023 as a dedicated centre for scale-ups and start-ups who are leading in climate\ninnovation. Since the relaunch the Cambridge Eagle Lab has focussed on growing the community and now has 19 climate focussed\nbusinesses residing out of the lab including Carbon 13 and Sustainable Ventures.\nCarbon 13 Venture Launchpad\nThe Carbon 13 Venture Launchpad in partnership with Barclays Eagle Labs supports early stage start-ups to launch high-potential, global\nimpact climate tech ventures. This climate tech accelerator helps supports early-stage founding teams to work intensively on their carbon\nimpact, investment readiness and go-to-market strategy.\nSustainable Ventures partnership\nEagle Labs ongoing work in the climate tech ecosystem has led to a partnership with Sustainable Ventures at their flagship site in London,\nwhere it has a dedicated Ecosystem Manager providing their members with access to Eagle Labs.

Disclosure\nexpectations in relation to climate change and sustainability matters are particularly fast moving, and differ from more traditional areas of\nreporting including in relation to the level of detail and forward-looking nature of the information involved and the consideration of impacts\non the environment and other persons. We have adapted our approach in relation to the disclosure of such matters. Our climate and\nsustainability disclosures take into account the wider context relevant to these topics, which may include evolving stakeholder views, the\ndevelopment of our climate strategy, longer timeframes for assessing potential risks and impacts, international long-term climate- and\nnature-based policy goals and evolving sustainability-related policy frameworks. Our climate and sustainability disclosures are subject to\nmore uncertainty than disclosures relating to other subjects given market challenges in relation to data reliability, consistency and\ntimeliness \u2013 the use of estimates, judgements and assumptions which are likely to change over time- the application and development of\ndata, models, scenarios and methodologies, the change in regulatory landscape, and variations in reporting standards.\nThese factors mean disclosures may be amended, updated, and recalculated in future as market practice and data quality and availability\ndevelops, and could cause actual achievements, results, performance or other future events or conditions to differ, in some cases\nmaterially, from those stated, implied and/or reflected in any forward-looking statements or metrics included in our climate and\nsustainability disclosures. We give no assurance as to the likelihood of the achievement or reasonableness of any projections, estimates,\nforecasts, targets, commitments, ambitions, prospects or returns contained in our climate and sustainability disclosures and make no\ncommitment to revise or update any such disclosures to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of such\nstatements.\n\u2022 Made certain key judgements, estimations and assumptions. This is, for example, the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio\nalignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and sustainability metrics, measurement of\nclimate risk and scenario analysis.\n\u2022 Used climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies Barclays consider to be appropriate and suitable for these\npurposes as at the date on which they were deployed. This includes data, models, scenarios and methodologies made available by third\nparties (over which we have no control) and which may have been prepared using a range of different methodologies, or where the\nbasis of preparation may not be known to Barclays. Methodologies, interpretations or assumptions may not be capable of being\nindependently verified and may therefore be inaccurate. Climate and sustainability data, models, scenarios and methodologies are\nsubject to future risks and uncertainties and may change over time. Climate and sustainability disclosures in this document, including\nclimate and sustainability-related data, models and methodologies, are not of the same standard as those available in the context of\nother financial information and use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to\nthe classification of climate and sustainable financing activities. Climate and sustainability disclosures are also not subject to the same\nor equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. Historical data\ncannot be relied on as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models,\nprocessed data, scenario analysis and the application of methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality, which can be\nhard to assess, or challenges in accessing data on a timely basis.\n\u2022 Continued (and will continue) to review and develop Barclays approach to data, models, scenarios and methodologies in line with\nmarket principles and standards as this subject area matures. The data, models, scenarios and methodologies used (including those\nmade available by third parties) and the judgements, estimates and/or assumptions made in them or by us are rapidly evolving, and\nthis may directly or indirectly affect the metrics, data points, targets, convergence points and milestones contained in the climate and\naccounting and/or reporting standards, improvements in data quality, data availability, or updates to methodologies and models and/\nor updates or restatements of data by third parties, could impact \u2013 potentially materially \u2013 the performance metrics, data points,\nreports we may present some or all of the information for this reporting period (including information made available by third parties)\nusing updated or more granular data or improved models, scenarios methodologies, market practices or standards.

Non-Executive Directors, including the Chair, are\ninformed of the minimum time commitment required prior to their appointment; they must, on appointment and on an ongoing basis, be\nable to devote sufficient time to the Company to effectively discharge their responsibilities. A Non-Executive Director\u2019s preparation for, and\nattendance at, Board and Board Committee meetings is only part of their role. In addition, Non-Executive Directors are expected to provide\neffective oversight and scrutiny, strategic guidance and constructive challenge whilst holding the Executive Directors to account against\ntheir agreed performance objectives.\nThe Directors\u2019 time commitments are considered by the Board on appointment and are reviewed annually. Before taking on any new\nexternal appointment, such appointment must be agreed with the Chair and disclosed to the Board, with an indication of the time involved.\nDuring the year, the Board kept under review the number of external directorships held by each Director and considered the limits on the\nnumber of directorships imposed by relevant regulations.

This is on the basis that the Board continues to believe that the Company\u2019s own\ngovernance arrangements are the most appropriate for it as a wholly owned subsidiary of a listed company which is also a complex\nfinancial institution subject to a comprehensive regulatory regime. This approach is consistent with the approach of other significant\nsubsidiaries in the Barclays Group which are subject to the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (2018 Regs).\n\u2022 are effective, in particular to ensure the safety, independence and soundness of the ring-fenced bank\n\u2022 provide checks and balances and encourage constructive challenge\n\u2022 drive informed, collaborative and accountable decision-making\n\u2022 create long-term sustainable value for our shareholder, Barclays, the ultimate shareholders of Barclays and our wider\nstakeholders\nSet out below is an explanation of how the six principles that underpin the Company\u2019s corporate governance arrangements have been\napplied during 2024.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group governance framework is set by Barclays and has been designed to facilitate the effective management of the\nBarclays Group. This includes the setting of Barclays Group policies in relation to matters such as the Barclays Group\u2019s Purpose, Values and\nMindset and the Barclays Group Remuneration Policy. Where appropriate, this Corporate Governance Statement makes reference to those\nBarclays Group-wide policies which are relevant to the way in which the Company is governed.\nPrinciple One: Board Leadership and Company Purpose\nA successful company is led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board whose role is to establish the company\u2019s purpose, values and\nstrategy, aligned to its culture, and make decisions to promote its success for the long-term benefit of its shareholder, having regard\nto the interests of other relevant stakeholders and factors.\nThe Board is collectively responsible for the overall leadership of the Company. This involves articulating a clear vision for the Company and\nestablishing a strategy for both the Company and the Barclays Bank UK Group, supported by a framework of effective controls that are\ndesigned to mitigate financial and other risks and to protect the reputation of the business.\nThe Board\u2019s role also involves ensuring that the Company is managed in accordance with the ring-fencing legislation, that the necessary\nresources are in place to enable the Company to meet its objectives, and measuring performance against those objectives.\nPrincipal activities of the Board in 2024\nStrategic and operational matters\n\u25aa Overseeing the shaping of and providing input into the Barclays Bank UK Group elements of the Barclays Group\u2019s three-year plan to\ncreate a \u201cSimpler, Better and More Balanced Bank\u201d, as announced in February 2024, including the focus areas (in respect of which\nfurther detail can be found in the \u201cPerformance review\u201d section of the Strategic Report) and related financial targets\n\u25aa In monitoring and overseeing execution of the Barclays Bank UK Group strategy during 2024, receiving enhanced reporting on\ncustomer experience and growth initiatives in business banking, secured lending, and unsecured lending and - in July 2024 -\nparticipating in a \u201cstrategy day\u201d with Executive Committee members to retest the strategy and review early progress against the focus\nareas\n\u25aa Receiving updates on the evolving geopolitical, macroeconomic and operational environment and overseeing the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s ongoing support of customers, clients and colleagues through those lenses\n\u25aa Considering and, in turn, overseeing Barclays UK\u2019s technology strategy, including \u2013 in conjunction with the Board Risk Committee \u2013 the\nchallenges and opportunities that technology presents for banking products and services (for example, AI and cybersecurity)\n\u2022 Overseeing customer, commercial, conduct, financial, operational, people, regulatory, risk, societal, sustainability and technology\nmatters, with regular updates from the Chief Executive and Executive Committee members on these key aspects of the business,\nsupported by key performance indicators and other metrics (where considered appropriate)\n\u2022 Overseeing reputational risk matters, including in relation to protest activity from activists\n\u25aa Overseeing, in conjunction with the Board Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee, the acquisition of Tesco Bank, which\ncompleted in November 2024, and the entry into a long-term, exclusive partnership with Tesco Stores Limited for an initial period of 10\nyears\n\u25aa Overseeing, in conjunction with the Board Risk Committee, the launch of a co-branded credit card with Amazon\n\u25aa Overseeing the continued embedment of the Consumer Duty and, in that context, approving the first Annual Consumer Duty Board\nReport, considering planning and readiness for the second implementation deadline of 31 July 2024 for closed products and services,\nenhancing fair value assessments in accordance with FCA insights, and monitoring customer outcomes via the quarterly Customer\nOutcomes Report\n\u25aa Receiving updates on developments in UK banking (for example, the October 2024 Court of Appeal judgments on commission\narrangements in the motor finance industry) and the evolving legal, political and regulatory landscape (including but not limited to the\ndraft statutory instrument amending the ring-fencing regime)", "page_start": 23, "page_end": 24, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

In addition, the Deputy Chair is available, if needed, to deputise for and support the\nChair in respect of the authorities and responsibilities conferred on or delegated to him by the Board from time to time.\nThe duties of the Board are executed in part through the Board Committees, which provide oversight and make recommendations on the\nmatters delegated to them by the Board. The Chair of each Board Committee provides a report on Board Committee business at each Board\nmeeting, including any matters being recommended to the Board for approval. Details on the principal Board Committees and their core\nresponsibilities and activities in 2024 are set out in Principles Three to Five on pages 25 to 30.\nChief Executive responsibilities\nResponsibility for the day-to-day management of the Company is delegated to the Chief Executive who is supported by the Company\u2019s\nExecutive Committee, which meets weekly. The Executive Committee supports the Chief Executive in ensuring that the Company\u2019s values,\nstrategy and culture align, are implemented and are communicated consistently to colleagues; for example, through townhalls, skip-level\nmeetings, site visits, leader-led sessions, focus groups and surveys. Further details are set out in the \u201cOur colleagues\u201d section of the\nStrategic Report.\nAccountability\nAccountability is driven through routine evaluations of the Board and Board Committees. For an overview of the recent external evaluation\nof the Board, Board Committees and Non-Executive Directors (including the Chair), please see page 26.\nDecision-making and independent challenge\nThe Board maintains a formal schedule of powers reserved to it in order to ensure that it has control over key decision-making. These\npowers include approval of key appointments, strategy, financial statements and any major acquisitions, mergers or disposals; the Board\nalso has the power to approve material non-financial matters impacting the Barclays Bank UK Group including, but not limited to, matters\ninvolving material conduct risk and/or reputation risk considerations as well as significant customer remediation matters and strategic\nbusiness changes.\nThere are also policies and procedures in place to support effective decision-making and independent challenge, including the Barclays\nGroup Corporate Governance Operating Manual, which sets out how Barclays Group entities and their respective Boards and Board\nCommittees should interact and, where appropriate, escalate issues.\nFor details of how the Directors have had regard to the matters set out in Section 172(1) of the Act when performing their duty to promote\nthe success of the Company under Section 172, and the effect of those considerations in reaching certain decisions taken by them, please\nrefer to the Section 172(1) Statement on pages 15 to 16 of the Strategic Report.\nIn accordance with the Act and the Company\u2019s Articles of Association, the Board has authority to authorise conflicts of interest, and this\nensures that the influence of third parties does not compromise or override the independent judgement of the Board. The Company\nSecretary maintains a conflicts register, which is a record of actual and potential conflicts, together with any Board authorisation of the\nconflict. Throughout the year, the Board has authorised a number of potential conflicts and, on occasion, put in place appropriate\nprocedures to manage that potential conflict. Following authorisation, all conflicts - whether actual or potential - are monitored in order to\nassist the relevant individuals in discharging their duties as a Director.\nPrinciple Three: Composition, Succession and Evaluation\nA Board with the right balance of skills, experience and diversity is critical to the sustainable delivery of value to the company\u2019s\nshareholder and broader stakeholders. The size of the Board should be guided by the scale and complexity of the company and\nappointments should be based on merit and objective criteria and with a view to promoting diversity and subject to a formal, rigorous\nand transparent procedure which is underpinned by an effective succession plan for the Board and senior management. A successful\nBoard is a cohesive Board that provides informed and constructive challenge to the management team and measures its\neffectiveness.\nBoard composition and succession\nOn 20 February 2024, aligned with Barclays\u2019 announcement of the resegmentation of its operating structure into five divisions, Vim Maru\nwas appointed as an Executive Director and Chief Executive. Matt Hammerstein stepped down from the Board as an Executive Director and\nChief Executive on the same day and was appointed as Chief Executive of the Barclays Group\u2019s UK Corporate Bank operating division. The\nBoard thanks Matt for his hard work, service and significant contribution to the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nThe Board Nominations Committee led the Chief Executive succession process, which culminated in the Committee recommending to the\nBoard that it appoint Vim. Vim has over 20 years\u2019 experience in the financial services sector - specifically, in retail banking - and was\npreviously Barclays Global Head of Consumer Banking and Payments and, prior to that, Group Director for Retail at Lloyds Banking Group.\nThe Board approved Vim\u2019s appointment in February 2024, subject to regulatory approval (which was subsequently given.)\nThe Directors have assessed the composition and size of the Board and have confirmed that they consider both to be appropriate for a\nlarge UK retail bank. This assessment is supported by a skills matrix (refreshed annually), which helps the Directors to evaluate the\nexperience and skills on the Board in order to ensure that there is the necessary expertise and knowledge to support and challenge\nmanagement in its execution of the strategy. There is currently a good balance between the Executive Directors and independent Non-\nExecutive Directors who, together, have a strong combination of financial, retail banking, risk and technical skills as well as experience in\ncolleague engagement, customer experience, culture, financial regulation, government, technology and transformation.", "page_start": 25, "page_end": 26, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

The Board Nominations Committee will - on behalf of the Board - continue to review the succession plans for key\nBoard positions, including Chair of the Board Audit Committee (on the basis that Andrew Ratcliffe\u2019s third term on the Board will come to an\nend in early 2026). To the extent that any appointment to the Board is made, such appointment will be based on merit. Objective criteria\nare used to ensure that the Board has the necessary experience, knowledge and skills to be effective in the execution of the strategy whilst\nrecognising the importance of diversity amongst the Directors including, but not limited to, diversity of experience, gender, ethnicity,\ngeography and thought.\nThe Board has achieved its gender diversity ambition - as set out in the Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy - to ensure that, by 2025, the\nproportion of women on the Board is at least 40% (female representation on the Board is currently 45%) and at least one of the following\nsenior Board positions is held by a woman: Chair, Chief Executive, or Chief Financial Officer. We are also pleased to report that the Board\nhas achieved its ethnic diversity ambition to ensure that at least one Board member is from a minority ethnic background (excluding white\nethnic groups) and that, having been met, this is maintained. The gender and ethnic diversity ambitions align to the targets adopted by\nBarclays (which reflect the requirements of the UK Listing Rules) and, in both cases, the ambitions were achieved with due regard to a fair\nand balanced recruitment process.\nWith regards to independence, the majority of the Board is considered to be independent. Independence is reviewed annually, using the\nindependence criteria set out in the ring-fencing requirements, and the Chair meets privately with the Non-Executive Directors, where\nappropriate, in order to promote the required independence.\nBoard evaluation\nDuring November and December 2024, an external evaluation of the Board, Board Committees and Non-Executive Directors (including the\nChair) was facilitated by Christopher Saul Associates (CSA), an independent, external corporate governance advisory firm with no\nconnection to the Barclays Bank UK Group or any individual Director other than as disclosed within the report of the Board Nominations\nmembers to obtain feedback on the effectiveness of the Board throughout 2024, and also attended Board and Board Committee meetings.\nCSA presented its final report to the Board on the findings of the evaluation in February 2025. The overall conclusion of the evaluation was\nthat the Board is operating effectively and that the Board Committees are well integrated into overall Board processes. The Board has a\ncollegiate and constructive culture, is well led, operates at a high standard, and benefits from quality support. However, certain areas were\nidentified for continued focus. These include ensuring that - during 2025 - sufficient time is dedicated to key transformational topics that\nare relevant to the long-term vision for the Barclays Bank UK Group and that there is an ongoing focus on medium-term Board and\nExecutive Committee succession planning as well as the simplification and timely circulation of Board papers. Work is underway to\nprogress these matters.\nThe evaluations of the Board Committees and Non-Executive Directors (including the Chair) concluded that they are meeting their required\nresponsibilities and operated effectively during 2024.\nBoard Nominations Committee\nThe Board Nominations Committee comprises independent Non-Executive Directors (see page 22).\nMeetings are attended by the Chief Executive and the Human Resources Director, at the invitation of the Committee Chair.\nThe principal role and responsibilities of the Committee are set out in its terms of reference and include:\n\u25aa Skills and Diversity - evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity for the Board and Board Committees and\nmore broadly across the senior management of the business\n\u25aa Director Appointments - identifying, and recommending to the Board, candidates for appointment to the Board and Board Committees\n\u25aa Director Independence - considering and assessing the independence of the Non-Executive Directors, including recommendations for\nany steps to manage actual or potential conflicts of interest\n\u25aa Board Performance - assessing the performance of the Non-Executive Directors and their annual time requirements\n\u25aa Board Evaluation - considering actions from the Board and Board Committee evaluation process and, in conjunction with the Board,\nreviewing the Board\u2019s progress against the recommendations arising from the evaluation process\n\u2022 Board Development - leading the development and effective implementation of policies and procedures for the induction, training and\nprofessional development of all members of the Board\n\u2022 Talent - overseeing the adoption of internal policies and talent progression for senior management\nDuring 2024, the principal activities of the Committee were:\n\u2022 Reviewing the Board\u2019s composition, including the skills and experience of Board members and the independence of the Non-Executive\nDirectors (excluding the Chair)\n\u25aa Leading, on behalf of the Board, the Chief Executive succession process, which culminated in February 2024 with the Committee\nrecommending to the Board that it appoint Vim Maru as an Executive Director and Chief Executive\n\u25aa Leading, on behalf of the Board, the process to appoint Andrew Ratcliffe\u2019s successor as Chair of the Board Audit Committee\n\u25aa Overseeing, on behalf of the Board, the process to identify Chris Pilling\u2019s successor as Consumer Duty Champion (which culminated in\nthe Board appointing John Liver into the role on 1 September 2024)\n\u25aa Reviewing and monitoring, on behalf of the Board, the Board\u2019s progress against the ambitions set out in the Board Diversity and\nInclusion Policy and the Company\u2019s progress against its ambition to build an inclusive, diverse and equitable culture where all\ncolleagues can thrive.

Talent and succession at both Executive Committee level and one level down will remain a key focus for\n2025 and beyond.\nPrinciple Four: Audit, Risk and Internal Control\nThe Board should establish formal and transparent policies and procedures to: (i) identify the nature and extent of principal risks the\ncompany is willing to take in order to achieve its long-term strategic objectives; (ii) manage such risks effectively; (iii) oversee the\ninternal control framework; (iv) promote the independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit functions; and (v) satisfy\nitself on the integrity of financial reporting.\nThe Company is committed to operating within a strong system of internal controls that enable business to be transacted and risk taken\nwithout exposure to unacceptable potential losses or reputational damage. The Principal Risks facing the Barclays Bank UK Group have\nbeen identified and robust processes are in place to evaluate and manage such risks including regular reporting to, and oversight by, the\nBoard Risk Committee and the Board. A key component of the risk management framework is the ERMF, which supports the business in its\naim to embed effective risk management and a strong risk management culture. The ERMF is designed to identify and set minimum\nrequirements, in respect of the main risks, to achieve the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s strategic objectives and to provide reasonable\nassurance that internal controls are effective. Further detail on the Principal Risks and management of them can be found in the \u201cManaging\nrisk\u201d section of the Strategic Report.\nThe Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that management maintains an effective system of risk management and internal controls\nand for assessing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to identify, evaluate and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to\nachieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. However,\nthe effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls system is also reviewed regularly by the Board Risk Committee and the\nBoard Audit Committee. Details of the role, responsibilities and activities of both Committees are set out below.\nThe Board receives regular reports on risk matters, including reputational risk matters, in order to ensure sufficient focus around strategic\nand emerging risks, including those arising from within the broader Barclays Group, which may impact the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nBoard Audit Committee\nThe Board Audit Committee comprises independent Non-Executive Directors (see page 22).\nAt the invitation of the Committee Chair, meetings are attended by management and others, including the Chief Executive, Chief Financial\nOfficer, Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Controls Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Financial\nController, General Counsel, the Company\u2019s statutory auditor and, at their request, Non-Executive Directors who are not members of the\nCommittee who wish to further their knowledge and understanding of audit matters. The Board, together with the Board Audit Committee,\nis responsible for ensuring the integrity of the financial statements and the independence and effectiveness of the internal audit function\nand the statutory auditor.

The Directors, via management, have regard to the need\nto foster business relationships with suppliers. We expect our Third Party Service Providers (TPSP) to make responsible decisions that,\nwhere relevant, take our stakeholders\u2019 needs into account in both the short and the long term. Barclays expects the TPSPs to comply with\napplicable laws, regulations and standards within the geographies in which they operate. Barclays\u2019 standard approach to new TPSP on-\nboarding and renewal begins by assessing the services that are being provided and ascertaining the level of risk. TPSPs that are assessed as\nbeing above a low risk of exposure from a business risk perspective (at the point of onboarding and on an ongoing basis) are subject to\nBarclays\u2019 Supplier Control Obligations (SCOs). TPSPs to whom the SCOs apply become managed TPSPs and are subject to ongoing\nmanagement and controls assurance during the term of service. Prior to contractual agreement and service go live, these TPSPs are\nrequired to complete a pre-contractual questionnaire which captures their adherence to the SCOs and Barclays\u2019 TPSP Code of Conduct\n(TPSP CoC). The TPSP CoC encourages our TPSPs to adopt our approach to doing business and details our expectations for matters\nincluding environmental management, and human rights, and also for living the Barclays Values.\nBarclays works closely with the Small Business Commissioner and other organisations, including Good Business Pays, to raise awareness to\nthe public and larger businesses on late payments and the impact these can have on businesses and business owners.\nFor more information on our engagement with customers and clients, please refer to the \u201cCustomers and clients\u201d section of the Strategic\nBranches and Country-by-Country Reporting\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group operates through branches, offices and subsidiaries in the UK.\nThe Company is exempt from publishing information required by The Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country Reporting) Regulations\n2013 as the information is published by its parent, Barclays PLC.

While these may vary in detail,\ngenerally they reflect internationally recognised privacy principles found in the UN\u2019s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European\nConvention on Human Rights and the European Union\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights.\nWe strive to operate in accordance with these standards and recognise that respect for privacy rights is a key element of good corporate\ngovernance and social responsibility. We strive to be transparent about our use of personal information when delivering our products and\nservices and acknowledge the responsibility we have for safeguarding privacy.\nAs Barclays increasingly adopts digital solutions to deliver next-generation consumer financial services, we appreciate our clients,\ncustomers and others may wish to understand how this may impact the use of their personal information. A globally applicable Barclays\nData Privacy Standard sets out what is expected of all Barclays businesses and functions when collecting, using and sharing personal\ninformation.\nTo promote clear accountability, the Standard includes the requirement for each business to appoint an accountable executive who has\nultimate responsibility for the processing of personal data within that business. An agreed assurance programme measures compliance\nwith the Data Privacy Standard. Barclays colleagues must complete annual privacy training which is reviewed and refreshed each year, with\nadditional tailored training provided as necessary. The Group Data Protection Officer (DPO) reports on data privacy issues to the highest\nlevel of management.\nThrough client, customer and employee privacy notices, we endeavour to explain clearly and openly how and why we use personal\ninformation and the legal grounds we rely on. When we receive complaints, we seek to address them fairly. Several jurisdictions also\nprovide individuals with specific rights, such as the right to have access to or request deletion of their personal information.\nBarclays provides a public mailbox and secure channels via its website to enable individuals to make their privacy requests and receive\nresponses from a dedicated team.\nBarclays requires its suppliers to comply with data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards relevant to the jurisdictions in\nwhich they operate and relevant to any transferred personal data. Our requirements are set out and principally managed through our\nsupplier contract templates, which require that suppliers commit to ensuring personal data shared with them is safeguarded and respected\nthroughout the supply chain.\nData security\nAs detailed below, Barclays' Chief Security Office and Chief Information Security Office operate controls aimed at mitigating cybersecurity-\nrelated risks and understanding internal and external threats.\nBarclays deploys controls designed to protect its sensitive information and the data that has been entrusted to us by customers and clients,\nin line with our Standards, taking into account findings from internal and external reviews of our controls.\nBarclays seeks to protect the security of data we share with third parties, including by conducting remote and on-site inspections with\ncertain suppliers to review their controls against contractual obligations and industry standards. A Third Party Service Provider Framework\nis in place which sets out control requirements for business units to manage the operational, reputational, conduct and legal risks to\nBarclays through its supply chain.\nIn operating under a hybrid working model, we have continued to educate colleagues on cybersecurity risks in order to help minimise risks\nrelated to remote working, such as data exploitation or leakage.\nBarclays works with industry bodies and cybersecurity vendors to learn from risk events in other organisations. Our teams use such\nintelligence to simulate plausible cybersecurity and data compromise scenarios that allow us to exercise, review and improve our response\nand recovery plans in preparation for evolving threats.\nOperational resilience\nCustomers and clients have increased expectations for us to be \u2018Always On\u2019.

They support Barclays' ability to operate in a protected and secure environment, and\nactively promote a culture of security as everyone's responsibility.\nThe Group Chief Security Officer and Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) head Barclays' Chief Security Office and Chief\nInformation Security Office, respectively. Group Chief Security Office is responsible for physical security, threat intelligence, crisis\nmanagement, and investigations and liaising with law enforcement, among other areas. Barclays' Group Chief Security Officer combines 10\nyears of law enforcement experience with over 20 years of experience in senior leadership roles managing security at global financial\ninstitutions, and is supported by a leadership team with expertise in threat intelligence, investigations, security transformation, and crisis\nmanagement, as well as other teams of subject matter experts and analysts.\nIn 2024, Barclays\u2019 Group CISO was elevated to report directly to the Group Chief Information Officer (a member of the Group Executive\nCommittee), to leverage the strategic and operational benefits of aligning cybersecurity and technology. The Group Chief Information\nOfficer reports to the Chief Operating Officer, and also sits on the Group Executive Committee. Barclays\u2019 Group CISO is responsible for\nassessing and managing Barclays\u2019 material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Group CISO is responsible for areas that, among others,\ninclude cybersecurity operations; internal penetration testing; third party security management; cryptography; vulnerability management;\ngovernance, risk, and compliance; cyber threat intelligence; and identity access management. The Group CISO has more than 20 years of\nexperience managing cybersecurity for global financial institutions, including responsibility for cybersecurity fusion centres, cyber\nintelligence, security engineering and architecture, security operations, and network services. The Group CISO is supported by a team of\nCISOs for individual business units and jurisdictions. Chief Information Security Office leaders manage Barclays\u2019 cybersecurity activities and\nare accountable for the day-to-day monitoring of residual risk, identification of gaps, oversight of remedial actions and implementation of\nstrategy. The Group CISO and supporting leadership team collectively have advanced degrees and senior level experience managing\ncybersecurity risks in a variety of sectors, including those that represent critical national infrastructure, such as telecommunications and\nfinancial institutions. They are supported by teams of subject matter experts and analysts in a variety of specialisations, such as penetration\ntesting, cyber-forensic investigations, security engineering, and vulnerability management.\nSupporting the delivery of Barclays\u2019 cyber and information security strategy are multiple management committees, forums, and councils,\nincluding Cyber Control Councils for each of the eleven Standards supporting the Group Information and Cybersecurity Policy. These Cyber\nControl Standards Councils feed into the Cybersecurity Horizontal Controls Forum, the Group Controls Committee, the Group Risk\nCommittee, and ultimately the Board Risk Committee. In addition, the Group COO holds standalone business reviews that include\nmanagement updates on the status of cybersecurity across the Group, and a standalone COO Controls Forum that also escalates to the\nGroup Controls Committee. Barclays\u2019 Operational Risk and internal audit functions provide independent views of cyber risk management\nfrom second and third line of defence perspectives.\nBarclays assesses its cybersecurity activities against the industry-recognised National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nCybersecurity Framework. Under Barclays' Enterprise Risk Management Framework, there is an Information and Cyber Security Policy\nsupported by eleven Standards which define the minimum requirements for cybersecurity matters across the Barclays Group. The Policy\nleverages key risk indicators defined in the Standards to integrate cybersecurity risk management into the Group\u2019s Enterprise Risk\nManagement Framework. The Standards cover the following topics: Cryptography, Network Security, Security Configuration, Data Loss\nPrevention, Vulnerability Management, Data Security, Incident Response & Threat Intelligence, Threat Management, Governance, Identity &\nAccess Management, and Application Security. The Group CISO approves and is accountable for the Information and Cyber Security Policy\nand associated Standards. As part of our programme, we periodically assess our performance against these Standards and identify areas\nfor improvement and remediation.\nThe Board Risk Committee, within its oversight of Operational Risk as a Principal Risk, is responsible for overseeing risks arising from\ncybersecurity threats. In 2024, the Group Chief Security Officer and Group CISO provided updates to the Board Risk Committee about\ncybersecurity risks facing the Group. Such updates addressed topics that included the cybersecurity threat environment and ransomware\nattack preparedness, measurement of Barclays' risk and control posture, cybersecurity incident trends and Barclays' response, plans to\nimprove Barclays' ability to recover from a material cyberattack scenario, Barclays\u2019 vulnerability management, privileged access to Barclays'\nsystems, regulatory developments, and risks and opportunities related to emerging technology and artificial intelligence.\nEngaging external security consultants to conduct penetration tests, attack simulations and other reviews to independently benchmark\nBarclays\u2019 cybersecurity capabilities is an important part of our cybersecurity programme that allows us to identify and remediate", "page_start": 36, "page_end": 37, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

The JOCs deliver security responsiveness by uniting core security functions and providing a central information and\ncoordination point for security incident management and escalation, based on defined severity levels. During live incidents, the Barclays\nCrisis Management Team monitors the response by Incident Management Teams, Resilience Leads, and others, and has discretion to\ninvoke one or more Barclays Crisis Leadership Teams (CLTs). CLTs are business-led teams at entity, business unit, and regional levels that\nprovide strategic leadership in a crisis, maintain incident management oversight, and coordinate key decision making.\nTo manage security risk from Barclays\u2019 third party suppliers, many of which perform critical services for Barclays businesses and handle\nsensitive Barclays data, we have a set of contractual Information and Cyber Security Supplier Control Obligations that are based on\nrequirements in our internal Standards. Using our dedicated Third Party Security Management team\u2019s capabilities, as well as third party\ntooling, we conduct assurance over our third and fourth parties against those obligations. Activity is structured on a risk-based approach\nthat prioritises suppliers that underpin our most important business services. Identified issues are managed formally, but we also engage\nproactively with third party suppliers to help them strengthen their security and resilience posture. To recognise the risk presented by third\nparty suppliers, which are increasingly targeted by threat actors, we regularly alert third party suppliers where we anticipate that they may\nbe more vulnerable and should take preventative action.\nNotwithstanding such third party risk management efforts, Barclays does not have direct control over the cybersecurity of the systems of\nits third and fourth parties, limiting the Group\u2019s ability to effectively protect and defend against certain threats.\nCertifications\nBarclays holds three ISO27001 certifications (i.e., the international standard on how to manage information security), Cyber Essentials /\nCyber Essentials Plus Certification, and a UK certification for Digital Banking.\nTraining\nBarclays requires colleagues to complete mandatory information security training at least annually.

It outlines the highest level arrangements\nfor risk management by setting out standards, objectives and key responsibilities of different groups of employees of the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup. It is approved by the Barclays PLC Board on recommendation of the Barclays Group Board Risk Committee and the Barclays Bank\nUK Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The Barclays Bank UK PLC Board then approves its adoption on the recommendation of its Risk\nCommittee, with modifications where needed.\nThe ERMF sets out:\n\u2022 risk management and segregation of duties: The ERMF defines a Three Lines of Defence model\n\u2022 principal risks faced by the Barclays Bank UK Group, which guide the organisation of risk management processes\n\u2022 risk appetite requirements: this helps define the level of risk the Barclays Bank UK Group is willing to undertake in its business\n\u2022 roles and responsibilities for risk management and governance.\nThe ERMF is complemented by frameworks, policies and standards that are mainly aligned to individual principal risks:\n\u2022 frameworks cover high level principles guiding the management of principal risks, and set out details of which policies are needed, and\nhigh level governance arrangements\n\u2022 policies set out the control objectives and high level requirements to address the key principles articulated in their associated\nframeworks. Policies state \u2018what\u2019 those within scope are required to do\n\u2022 standards set out the detail of the control requirements to ensure the control objectives set by the policies are met.\nSegregation of duties - the \"Three Lines of Defence\" model\nThe ERMF sets out a clear lines of defence model. All colleagues are responsible for understanding and managing risks within the context\nof their individual roles and responsibilities, as set out below.\n\u2022 The first line comprises all employees engaged in the revenue generating and client facing areas of the Barclays Bank UK Group and all\nassociated support functions, including Finance, Operations, Treasury, and Human Resources. The first line is responsible for identifying\nand managing the risks in which they are engaged, operating within applicable limits, and escalating risk events or issues as appropriate.\nEmployees in the first line have primary responsibility for their risks and their activities are subject to oversight from the relevant parts of\nthe second and third lines.\n\u2022 The second line comprises the Risk and Compliance functions. The role of the second line is to establish the limits, rules and constraints,\nand the frameworks, policies and standards under which all activities shall be performed, consistent with the risk appetite of the Barclays\nBank UK Group, and to oversee the performance of the Barclays Bank UK Group against these limits, rules and constraints. Controls for\nfirst line activities will ordinarily be established by the control officers operating within the control framework of the firm. These will\nremain subject to oversight by the second line.\n\u2022 The third line of defence is Internal Audit, and is responsible for providing independent assurance over the effectiveness of governance,\nrisk management and controls over current, systemic and evolving risks.\n\u2022 The Legal function provides support to all areas of the bank and is not formally part of any of the three lines of defence. The Legal\nfunction is responsible for proactively identifying, communicating and providing legal advice on applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nExcept in relation to the legal advice it provides or procures, it is subject to second line oversight with respect to its own operational and\ncompliance risks, as well as with respect to the legal risk to which the bank is exposed.\nTesco Bank acquisition\nOn 1 November 2024, the Barclays Bank UK Group completed the acquisition of Tesco Bank which includes credit cards, unsecured\npersonal loans, deposits and the operating infrastructure. Following the acquisition, the acquired Tesco Bank business continues to operate\nlargely within its own risk framework, with dispensations in place for material divergences from existing Barclays Bank UK Group policy\nrequirements. Any subsequent changes to the Tesco Bank approach will be part of integration planning activity.\nPrincipal risks\nThe ERMF identifies ten principal risks (see managing risk in the strategic report section) namely: credit risk, market risk, treasury and\ncapital risk, climate risk, operational risk, model risk, compliance risk, financial crime risk, reputation risk and legal risk. In 2024, financial\ncrime risk was elevated to a principal risk, effective from 1 January 2025. Previously, financial crime risk was managed as part of\ncompliance risk. Recognising the increased external threat of financial crime, this change will enhance transparency and visibility of\nfinancial crime risk within the Barclays Bank UK Group and reinforce independent assessment, management and oversight of financial\ncrime risk.", "page_start": 40, "page_end": 42, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

In addition, certain risks span across more than one principal risk.\nRisk appetite\nRisk appetite is defined as the level of risk which the Barclays Group is prepared to accept in carrying out its activities. It provides a basis for\nongoing dialogue between management and Board with respect to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s current and evolving risk profile, allowing\nstrategic and financial decisions to be made on an informed basis.\nRisk appetite is approved by the Barclays PLC Board in aggregate and disseminated across legal entities and businesses, including the\nBarclays Bank UK Group. The Barclays Bank UK Board cannot approve a higher risk appetite than that determined by the Barclays PLC\nBoard without the approval of the Barclays PLC Board, but may choose to operate at a lower level of risk appetite than that approved by the\nBarclays PLC Board. The Barclays Group total risk appetite and its allocation to the Barclays Bank UK Group are supported by limits to\nenable and control specific exposures and activities that have material concentration risk implications.\nRisk review\nRisk management\nRisk committees\nThe various Barclays Bank UK Group risk committees consider risk matters relevant to their business, and escalate as required to the\nBarclays UK Risk Committee, whose Chair, in turn, escalates to the Barclays Group Risk Committee, Barclays Bank UK PLC Board Risk\nCommittee and the Barclays Bank UK PLC Board.\nRisk Management\nBoard Committees Barclays PLC Board\nBarclays\nCommittees Barclays Bank UK PLC Board\nUK ExCo\n(including Risk and\nAudit Committees)\nBarclays Bank UK\nBarclays Bank UK Barclays Bank UK\nPLC Board\nPLC Board Risk PLC Board Audit\nRemuneration\nCommittee Committee\nCommittee\nManagement Level\nBarclays PLC\nCommittees/ Barclays Group\nBarclays UK Risk Committee Remuneration\nForums Risk Committee\nReview Panel\nBusiness Level\nCommittees/ Barclays Bank UK PLC Product/\nForums Risk Type Committees\nThe Barclays UK Risk Committee is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the risk profile of the Barclays\nBank UK Group.

These are: the Barclays Bank UK PLC Board Risk Committee and the Barclays Bank UK PLC Board Audit Committee.\nAdditionally, the Barclays Bank UK PLC Board Remuneration Committee oversees pay practices focusing on aligning pay to sustainable\nperformance.\n\u25aa The Barclays Bank UK PLC Board Risk Committee (BRC): The BRC monitors Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s risk profile against the agreed\nappetite. Where actual performance differs from expectations, the actions taken by management are reviewed to ascertain that the\ncommittee is comfortable with them. The Barclays Bank UK Group CRO regularly presents a report to the BRC summarising\ndevelopments in the risk environment and performance trends in the key portfolios. The BRC also reviews certain key risk methodologies,\nthe effectiveness of risk management, and Barclays Bank UK Group's risk profile, including the material issues affecting each business\nportfolio and forward risk trends. The committee also commissions in-depth analyses of significant risk topics, which are presented by\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group CRO or senior risk managers in the business.\n\u25aa The Barclays Bank UK PLC Board Audit Committee (BAC): The BAC receives regular reports on the effectiveness of internal control\nsystems, on material control issues of significance and on accounting judgements, including a review of the adequacy of impairment\nallowances.\n\u25aa The Barclays Bank UK PLC Board Remuneration Committee (RemCo): The RemCo receives proposals on ex-ante and ex-post risk\nadjustments to variable remuneration based on risk management performance including events, issues and the wider risk profile.

This is supported by\nour Purpose, Values and Mindset, as well by as by setting a standard of consistent excellence. Specifically, all employees regardless of their\npositions, functions or locations must play their part in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s risk management.

See home.barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/statements-and-policy-positions/ for more details.\nRisk review\nMaterial existing and emerging risks\nMaterial existing and emerging risks to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s future performance\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group has identified a broad range of risks to which its businesses are exposed. Material risks are those to which\nsenior management pay particular attention and which could cause the delivery of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s strategy, results of\noperations, financial condition and/or prospects to differ materially from expectations. Emerging risks are those which have unknown\ncomponents, the impact of which could crystallise over a longer time period. The factors set out below should not be regarded as a\ncomplete and comprehensive statement of all the potential risks and uncertainties which the Barclays Bank UK Group faces For example,\ncertain other factors beyond the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s control, including escalation of global conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural\ndisasters, pandemics and similar events, although not detailed below, could have a similar impact on the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nMaterial existing and emerging risks potentially impacting more than one principal risk\ni) Business conditions, general economy and geopolitical issues\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s operations are subject to changes in global and local economic and market conditions, as well as geopolitical\ndevelopments, which may have a material impact on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and\nprospects.\nA deterioration in global or local economic and market conditions may result in (among other things): (i) deteriorating business, consumer\nor investor confidence and lower levels of investment and productivity, which in turn may lead to lower customer and client activity,\nincluding lower demand for borrowing; (ii) higher default rates, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges as borrowers struggle\nwith their debt commitments; (iii) subdued asset prices, which may impact the value of collateral held by the Barclays Bank UK Group and\nrequire the Barclays Bank UK Group and its clients to post additional collateral in order to satisfy margin calls; and (iv) revisions to\ncalculated expected credit losses (ECLs) leading to increases in impairment allowances. In addition, the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to\nborrow from other financial institutions or raise funding from external investors may be affected by deteriorating economic conditions and\nmarket disruption. Geopolitical events can also cause financial instability and affect economic growth.\nDuring 2024, global economic growth has remained muted, mainly driven by a more uncertain geopolitical environment, a high interest\nrate environment, an economic slowdown in China and continued structural economic issues in the UK and EU. Without limitation, the\nBarclays Bank UK Group has observed the following macroeconomic risk themes / trends:\n\u2022 Limitations on economic output growth, mostly driven by: (i) tight labour markets and low productivity growth in the main western\neconomies; (ii) large fiscal deficits; and (iii) high energy prices and strained global supply chains driven by geopolitical events such as\nthe Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East have made central banks pursue a slower than expected reduction path for interest\nrates. In 2024 these \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rates have dampened economic activity, increasing fears of a hard-landing scenario across the\nUS, Europe and the UK which could have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group's results of operations and\nprofitability.\n\u2022 The adoption of tariffs and other protectionist measures or countermeasures, particularly by the US, would further complicate the\neconomic outlook for the EU, China and other export-driven emerging markets given their trade surpluses. This could have a material\nadverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business in the affected region.\n\u2022 The UK, which is the Barclays Bank UK Group's main retail banking market, faces a number of structural challenges. The Labour\ngovernment has identified economic growth as a priority. However, the long-term impacts of the latest budget and tax increases\nremain uncertain with risks to the Barclays Bank UK Group's retail and corporate businesses in case of economic underperformance.\nThis could have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group's results of operations and profitability.\n\u2022 The loss of \u2018the presumption of conformity\u2019 is widely reported to have raised costs for UK customers exporting to the EU as it results in\ntheir products no longer presumed to be in line with corresponding EU rules, which, together with the risk of regulatory divergence\nbetween the UK and the EU, could adversely impact the Barclays Bank UK Group operations.\nA deterioration in the aforementioned economic and business environment could result in (among other things):\n\u2022 A prolonged slowdown in the markets where the Barclays Bank UK Group operates, with lower economic output, higher\nunemployment, and depressed property prices, which could lead to increased impairments in relation to a number of Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s portfolios (including, but not limited to, the mortgage portfolio, the unsecured lending portfolio (including credit cards) and\ncommercial real estate exposures).\n\u2022 Increased market volatility (in particular in currencies and interest rates), which could affect the underlying value of assets held in the\nbanking book including securities held by the Barclays Bank UK Group for liquidity purposes. In addition, market confidence and\ndepositor perceptions of banking fragility as seen in certain institutions in 2023 could increase the severity and velocity of deposit\noutflows, impacting Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s liquidity position;\n\u2022 A credit rating downgrade for one or more members of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s parent entity, Barclays PLC (either directly or\nindirectly as a result of a downgrade in the UK sovereign credit ratings), which could significantly increase the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s cost of funding and/or reduce its access to funding, widen credit spreads and have a material adverse impact on the Barclays\nBank UK Group\u2019s interest margins and liquidity position; and/or\n\u2022 A market-wide widening of credit spreads or reduced investor appetite for Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s debt securities, which could\nnegatively impact the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s cost of and/or access to funding.", "page_start": 44, "page_end": 46, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Further geopolitical deterioration, in particular\nin the Middle East and/or South China Sea and trade war related de-coupling of production chains could also have a negative impact\non the markets in which the Barclays Bank UK Group operates.\nThe circumstances mentioned above could have a material adverse effect on Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, prospects, liquidity, capital position and credit ratings (including potential credit rating agency changes of outlooks or\nratings), as well as on Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s customers, clients, employees and suppliers.\nii) The impact of interest rate changes on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s profitability\nThe impact from changes to the Bank of England base interest rate and swap rates are potentially significant for the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup, especially given the uncertainty as to the size and frequency of such changes.\nLower interest rates could put pressure on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s net interest margins (the difference between lending income and\nborrowing costs) due to either a delay in passthrough or a smaller passthrough of the interest rate cuts to customer deposits. This could\nadversely affect the profitability and prospects of the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nHigher interest rates could result in higher funding costs either due to higher refinancing costs or due to deposit balance mix changes as\ncustomers prefer switching into deposits that pay a higher rate. In addition, interest rates remaining higher for longer (due to either smaller\nor less frequent than expected interest rate cuts, or larger or more frequent than expected interest rate increases), could lead to generally\nweaker than expected growth, reduced business confidence and higher unemployment. This, combined with the impact that higher\ninterest rates may have on the affordability of loan arrangements for borrowers (especially when combined with inflationary pressures),\ncould cause stress in the lending portfolio. This could result in higher credit losses driving increased impairment charges which would most\nnotably impact retail unsecured portfolios and could have a material effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the value of the securities held in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s liquid\nasset portfolio. Consequently, this could create more volatility than expected through the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s fair value through other\ncomprehensive income (FVOCI) reserve and could adversely affect the profitability and prospects of the Barclays Bank UK Group.\niii) Competition in the banking and financial services industry\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to significant changes as a\nresult of regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes to market and economic conditions. The\nBarclays Bank UK Group expects that competition in the financial services industry will remain intense and may have a material adverse\neffect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s future business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-\ncommerce have made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products such as electronic\nsecurities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, payments processing\nand other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as blockchain (used in cryptocurrency systems) and \u2018buy now pay\nlater\u2019 lending, both of which are currently subject to lower levels of regulatory oversight compared to many activities undertaken by banks.\nFurthermore, the introduction of central bank digital currencies could have a significant impact on the banking system and the role of\ncommercial banks by disrupting the current provision of banking products and services. This disruption could allow new competitors, some\npreviously hindered by banking regulation (such as certain FinTechs), to provide customers with access to banking facilities and increase\nthe disintermediation of banking services.\nNew technologies and changing consumer behaviour have previously required, and could continue to require, the Barclays Bank UK Group\nto incur additional costs to modify or adapt its products or make additional capital investments in its businesses to attract and retain clients\nand customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. For example, the Barclays\nBank UK Group has begun to take steps to expand its investment in and to integrate AI technologies, including generative AI. Such AI\ntechnologies and services are rapidly evolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet\nthe changing needs and expectations of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s customers and clients. Failure to efficiently develop or integrate such\nAI technologies may impact the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s competitive position and its ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs\nassociated with its operations and to offer innovative products and services to customers.", "page_start": 46, "page_end": 47, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

This competition may be on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution,\ninnovation, reputation and/or price. These factors may be exacerbated by further regulatory change. The failure of any of the Barclays Bank\nUK Group\u2019s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, underperformance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular product or service, branch closures, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could\naffect the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce the Barclays\nBank UK Group\u2019s revenues.\niv) Regulatory change agenda and impact on business model\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s businesses are subject to ongoing regulation and associated regulatory risks, including the effects of\nchanges in the laws, regulations, policies, voluntary codes of practice and interpretations of the foregoing in the UK and, in some cases,\nother jurisdictions. Many legislative and regulatory changes that are relevant to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business may have an effect\nbeyond the country in which they are enacted, either because sectoral regulators within the banking and finance industries and legislators\nin national and supranational governments deliberately enact laws and/or regulations with extra-territorial effect or because the nature or\nlocation of its operations mean that the Barclays Bank UK Group gives effect to local laws and regulations on a wider basis.\nIn recent years, regulators and governments have focused on reforming both the prudential regulation of the financial services industry and\nthe ways in which the business of financial services is conducted. Measures taken include enhanced capital, liquidity and funding\nrequirements, the structural separation or prohibition of certain activities by banks, the introduction of tax levies and transaction taxes,\nchanges in compensation practices, and more detailed requirements on how business is conducted and customers are treated.\nGovernments and regulators in the UK or elsewhere may intervene further in relation to areas of industry risk and/or regulatory risk already\nidentified, or in new areas, which could adversely affect the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nCurrent and anticipated areas of particular focus for the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s regulators, where regulatory changes could have a\nmaterial effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, capital, liquidity or funding\nposition, and reputation include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 the continued focus by regulators, international bodies, organisations and unions on how institutions conduct business,\nparticularly with regard to the delivery of fair outcomes for customers, promoting effective competition in the interests of\nconsumers and ensuring the orderly and transparent operation of global financial markets, including the Consumer Duty in the\nUK and review of the provision of financial advice to consumers;\n\u2022 the implementation of any conduct measures as a result of regulators\u2019 focus on and review of organisational culture, employee\nbehaviour and whistleblowing, as well as proposals for a new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion in the UK, with a\nparticular focus on firms\u2019 management of non-financial misconduct matters;\n\u2022 the UK regulators\u2019 strategy for and promotion of competitive markets and growth, both domestically and internationally;\n\u2022 the increasing regulatory expectations and requirements relating to various aspects of operational resilience, including an\nincreasing focus on minimising the impact of operational disruptions (including digital operational disruptions) on the UK\nfinancial sector, the role of critical third-party service providers to financial institutions, and operational incident and third party\nreporting requirements;\n\u2022 the focus globally on technology adoption and digital delivery, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI), digital assets and\ndigital money (including central bank digital currencies), payments and related infrastructure, and cybersecurity.

The Barclays\nGroup announced, as part of the Investor Update in February 2024, a plan to become simpler, better and more balanced. This strategic plan\nis intended to enable the Barclays Group to improve its customer service, provide more support to consumers and businesses, deliver\nhigher quality income growth and build returns. Accordingly, effective management of transformation projects is required to successfully\ndeliver the Barclays Bank UK Group's strategic priorities, involving delivering both on externally driven programmes, as well as key business\ninitiatives to deliver revenue growth, product enhancement and operational efficiency outcomes. The magnitude, complexity and, at times,\nconcurrent demands of the projects required to meet these priorities can result in heightened execution risk.\nThe ability to execute the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s strategy may be limited by operational capacity and the increasing complexity of the\nregulatory environment in which the Barclays Bank UK Group operates. In addition, whilst the Barclays Bank UK Group continues to pursue\ncost management initiatives, they may not be as effective as expected and cost saving targets may not be met.\nThe failure to successfully deliver or achieve any of the expected benefits of these strategic initiatives and/or the failure to meet customer\nand stakeholder expectations could have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition, customer outcomes, prospects and reputation.", "page_start": 48, "page_end": 49, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Integrating an acquired business can be both challenging and costly, requiring changes to accounting\nsystems, data processing systems and management controls. The integration process could disrupt ongoing operations or lead to\ninconsistencies in controls, procedures and policies, which could negatively impact the Barclays Bank UK Group's ability to maintain\nrelationships with customers, suppliers and other business stakeholders, including Tesco Stores Limited. The establishment of the Tesco\nPartnership introduces complexity and could adversely impact the overall benefits achieved. Additionally, the loss of key colleagues in\nconnection with the acquisition could adversely affect the Barclays Bank UK Group's ability to successfully conduct its business.\nWhile the Barclays Bank UK Group has completed the Tesco Bank acquisition, certain infrastructure continues to be shared with the\nbusiness retained by Tesco Personal Finance PLC (i.e., Tesco Insurance and Money Services) to ensure continuity of both operations. The\ncost and timing to complete this separation may vary from anticipated plans, and will require changes to accounting systems, data\nprocessing systems and management controls.\nvii) Card Partnerships\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group maintains several co-branded credit cards and credit card partnership agreements. Such arrangements are a\nmeans of reaching new customers and expanding brand reach, but there is significant competition among card issuers for these\nrelationships. A deterioration in or failure to maintain these credit card relationships with co-brand partners, including non-renewal of\ncontracts with existing partners, early termination of partnership arrangements due to a contractual breach and changes in consumer\nbehaviour regarding spending patterns, could have a negative impact on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and prospects.\nMaterial existing and emerging risks impacting individual principal risks\ni) Climate risk\nClimate risk is the risk of financial losses arising from climate change, through physical risks and risks associated with transitioning to a\nlower carbon economy.\nThe effects of climate change may be highly significant in their breadth and magnitude and could affect a large number of firms operating\nin different sectors and geographies, leading to potential downstream effects to the financial system.\nThere is a potential direct impact on banks and other financial institutions through their operations, as well as indirectly through customers\nand clients. Given this context and to support the Group\u2019s ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, Climate Risk is a Principal Risk under\nBarclays\u2019 ERMF. It manages the financial and operational risks of climate change.\nPhysical risks, such as acute weather events (e.g. cyclones, hurricanes and floods) and long-term climate pattern shifts (e.g. droughts,\ntemperature and precipitation levels) can lead to damage to fixed assets, operational disruptions, changes in production outputs and\nincreased costs. The potential impacts of physical risk events on the economy may include lower GDP growth, higher unemployment,\nshortage of raw materials and products, supply chain disruptions, significant fluctuations in prices of assets (such as in the real estate\nsector) and shifting demands for goods and service. These factors could subsequently impact the business model and profitability of\nBarclays Bank UK Group and its clients by negatively impacting, among other things: (1) the creditworthiness of clients which may result in\nhigher defaults, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges in Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s portfolios; (ii) the creditworthiness of the\nsovereigns of countries in which they occur. The deterioration in the credit ratings of sovereign bonds could affect their access to capital\nand their eligibility for inclusion in banks\u2019 liquidity buffers; and (iii) the value of investments which the Bank holds.\nA transition to a low-carbon economy requires policy and regulatory changes, new national and regional commitments, new technological\ninnovations and changes to supply and demand systems within industries. The transition to a low-carbon economy may also trigger\nchanges in consumer behaviour and market sentiment. This gives rise to transition risks from increased costs and reduced demand for the\nproducts and services of a company including early retirement and impairment of assets, or decreased revenue and profitability.\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s clients that are more susceptible and exposed to these changes may face operational and financial difficulties\nwhich in turn may impact their creditworthiness. In addition, climate-related legal actions or investigations may have material financial\nimpacts on the Barclays Bank UK Group's clients, customers and counterparties (particularly in high carbon sectors). This in turn can\nincrease credit risk within group portfolios (for further details on credit risk, refer to ii) Credit Risk on page 50).", "page_start": 49, "page_end": 50, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

This in turn can\nincrease credit risk within group portfolios (for further details on credit risk, refer to ii) Credit Risk on page 50).\nRisk review\nMaterial existing and emerging risks\nBoth physical risk and transition risk factors have the potential to trigger large, sudden and negative price adjustments where climate risk\nhas not yet been incorporated into prices, which could increase market risk in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s portfolios. Fluctuations in\nmarkets and prices of assets in susceptible sectors or countries could drive losses to the value of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s assets and\nliabilities.\nPhysical risk and transition risk factors can lead to impacts on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s own operations including damage or\nunsuitability of premises, disruption to business operations and supply chains and it\u2019s ability to recover from outages (e.g. caused by\nworkforce, technology and third-party service providers). For example, extreme weather events can impact the operation of bank offices,\nbranches, and support facilities such as data centres. Additionally, Barclays Bank UK Group has experienced and may continue to\nexperience in the future, disruptions in its operations as a result of branch closures and security breaches due to climate-related protests\nagainst the Group due to its lending activities. Transition risk can also lead to secondary impacts on operational risks, such as the risk of\nmisreporting as a result of enhanced regulatory disclosures requirements.\nThere is significant uncertainty surrounding the timeframes in which both physical and transition risks may manifest, driven by the\ninterplay of environmental, political and societal factors. Physical risks, such as acute weather events and long-term climate pattern shifts,\nare difficult to predict due to complex interactions between climate system dynamics and human activities. Similarly, the timing of\ntransition risks arising from factors like policy changes, technological innovations or shifts in market sentiment are equally unpredictable.\nThis poses significant challenges to the Barclays Bank UK Group in assessment, quantification, and management of climate risk.\nBarclays Bank UK Group also needs to ensure that its strategy and business model adapt to changing national and international standards,\nindustry and scientific practices, regulatory requirements and market expectations regarding climate change, which remain under\ncontinuous development. The Barclays Bank UK Group may face challenges from changing circumstances and external factors which are\nbeyond the Group\u2019s control, including geopolitical issues, energy security, energy poverty and other considerations such as a just transition\nto a low-carbon economy. Achieving the Group's climate-related ambitions and targets (which includes the Bank\u2019s portfolio\u2019s) will also\ndepend on a number of factors outside the Group's control, including reliable forecasts of hazards from physical climate models and\navailability of data / models to measure / assess climate impact on clients. The pathway to net zero is uncertain, complex and dependent\non progress in various areas such as advances in low-carbon technologies, collective action by clients to meet their own net zero goals, and\nsupportive public policies in markets where Barclays operates. If there is a lack of progress in the aforementioned areas, Barclays may fail to\nachieve its climate-related ambitions and targets, and this could have a material adverse effect on Barclays\u2019 business, operations, financial\ncondition, prospects and reputation.\nFor further detail on how Barclays Bank UK Group manages the risks associated with climate change, refer to the Climate Risk Management\nsection.\nii) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of loss to the Barclays Bank UK Group from the failure of clients, customers or counterparties, including sovereigns, to\nfully honour their obligations to members of the Barclays Bank UK Group, including the whole and timely payment of principal, interest,\ncollateral, and other receivables. Credit risk is impacted by a number of factors outside the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s control, including\nwider economic conditions.\na) Impairment\nImpairment is calculated in line with the requirements of IFRS9. Loss allowances, based on ECLs, are measured on a forward-looking basis\nusing a broad range of financial metrics and application of complex judgements. Accordingly, impairment charges are potentially volatile\nand may not successfully predict actual credit losses, particularly under stressed conditions. Failure by the Barclays Bank UK Group to\naccurately estimate credit losses through ECLs could have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of\noperations, financial condition, and prospects. For further details, refer to Note 8.\nb) Specific portfolios, sectors, and concentrations\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group is subject to risks arising from changes in credit quality and recovery rates for loans and advances due from\nborrowers and counterparties. Additionally, the Barclays Bank UK Group is subject to a concentration of those risks where it has significant\nexposures to borrowers and counterparties in specific sectors, or to particular types of borrowers and counterparties. Any deterioration in\nthe credit quality of such borrowers and counterparties could lead to lower recoverability from loans and advances, and higher impairment\ncharges. Accordingly, any of the following areas of uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects:\n\u25aa Consumer affordability: whilst the pressures from increased cost of living eased in the latter half of 2024 as interest rates and inflation\nfell, this remains an area of focus. Macroeconomic factors, such as unemployment, high interest rates or broader inflationary pressures,\nwhich impact a customer\u2019s ability to service debt payments, could lead to increased arrears in both unsecured and secured products.\n\u2022 UK Retail, Hospitality and Leisure: despite holding up reasonably well during most of 2024, continuing cost of living pressures, falling\nconsumer confidence, or other macroeconomic factors adversely affecting consumers could trigger a contraction in demand which,\ntogether with rising business costs and, for UK retail, a structural shift to online shopping, would add pressure to sectors heavily reliant\non consumer discretionary spending. This represents a potential risk in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s corporate portfolio as a higher\nprobability of default exists for retailers, hospitality providers and their landlords while these pressures remain.", "page_start": 50, "page_end": 51, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Following interest rate cuts in 2024,\nhousing market activity increased and is likely to continue with further interest rate cuts. However, as mortgages continue to roll off\nexisting rates onto new higher rates, there is an increased risk of borrower defaults. This could put further downward pressure on\nproperty prices and, in turn, impact the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s impairment and capital position. Furthermore, certain segments of\nthe housing market could be subject to specific valuation impacts (for example, certain properties within the Barclays Bank UK Group's\nresidential loan portfolio may be subject to remediation activities relating to fire safety standards; similarly, certain properties within the\nBarclays Bank UK Group's buy-to-let portfolio may be subject to remediation activities to meet minimum Energy Performance\nCertificate rating requirements).\nImpact to the creditworthiness of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s clients, customers and counterparties (particularly in high carbon sectors),\ncan also arise out of climate-related legal actions or investigations commenced against the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s clients, customers\nand counterparties (particularly in high carbon sectors), where outcomes of such actions have material financial impacts, which can in turn\nincrease credit risk within the Barclays Bank UK Group portfolios. For further details on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s approach to credit\nrisk, refer to the credit risk management and credit risk performance section.\niii) Treasury and capital risk\nThere are three primary types of treasury and capital risk faced by the Barclays Bank UK Group:\na) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Barclays Bank UK Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have\nthe appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets. This could cause the Barclays Bank UK Group\nto fail to meet regulatory and/or internal liquidity requirements, make repayments of principal or interest as they fall due or to support day-\nto-day business activities. Key liquidity risks that the Barclays Bank UK Group faces include:\n\u25aa Stability of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s deposit funding profile: deposits which are payable on demand or at short notice could be\nadversely affected by the Barclays Bank UK Group failing to preserve the current level of customer and investor confidence or as a\nresult of competition in the banking industry.\n\u2022 Impacts of market volatility: adverse market conditions, with increased volatility in asset prices, could: (i) negatively impact the Barclays\nBank UK Group\u2019s liquidity position through increased derivative margin requirements and/or wider haircuts when monetising liquidity\npool securities; (ii) make it more difficult to execute secured financing transactions; and (iii) expose the Barclays Bank UK Group to\ncurrency risk leading to increased cash flow currency mismatch.\n\u25aa Intraday liquidity usage: increased cash and collateral requirements for payments and securities settlement systems could negatively\nimpact the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s liquidity position, as cash and liquid assets required for intraday purposes are unavailable to meet\nother outflows.\n\u25aa Off-balance sheet commitments: deterioration in economic and market conditions could cause customers to draw on off-balance\nsheet commitments provided to them, for example, revolving credit facilities, negatively affecting the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s liquidity\nposition.\n\u25aa Credit rating changes and impact on funding costs: any reductions in a credit rating (in particular, any downgrade below investment\ngrade) may affect the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s access to money markets and/or the terms on which the Barclays Bank UK Group is\nable to obtain market funding. For example, this could lead to increased costs of funding and wider credit spreads, the triggering of\nadditional collateral or other requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements, or limits on the range of\ncounterparties who are willing to enter into transactions with the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nThese liquidity risks were not materially changed by the acquisition of the retail banking assets and liabilities of Tesco Bank on 1 November\n2024. Primary liquidity risks from this acquisition relate to the deposit book and off-balance sheet commitments in the form of available\ncredit on Credit Cards.\nb) Capital risk\nCapital risk is the risk that the Barclays Bank UK Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business\nactivities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments and stressed conditions (both actual and as\ndefined for internal planning or regulatory stress testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Barclays Group\u2019s pension plans. Key\ncapital risks that the Barclays Bank UK Group faces include:\n\u2022 Failure to meet prudential capital requirements: this could lead to the Barclays Bank UK Group being unable to support some or all of\nits business activities, a failure to pass regulatory stress tests, increased cost of funding due to deterioration in investor appetite or\ncredit ratings, restrictions on distributions and/or the need to take additional measures to strengthen the Barclays Bank UK Group's\ncapital or leverage position.\n\u2022 Adverse changes in FX rates impacting capital ratios: the Barclays Bank UK Group share capital is denominated in sterling. However,\nsome capital resources and MREL are denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely", "page_start": 51, "page_end": 52, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

However,\nsome capital resources and MREL are denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely\nRisk review\nMaterial existing and emerging risks\nimpact the sterling equivalent value of these items. As a result, the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s regulatory capital ratios are sensitive to\nforeign currency movements. Failure to appropriately manage the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s balance sheet to take account of foreign\ncurrency movements could result in an adverse impact on its regulatory capital.\nc) Interest rate risk in the banking book\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is the risk that the Barclays Bank UK Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a\nmismatch between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities. This also includes credit spread risk in the banking\nbook, the risk that the Barclays Bank UK Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of changes in credit spreads on its (non-\ntraded) assets and liabilities. The Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s hedging programmes for interest rate risk in the banking book rely on\nbehavioural assumptions and, as a result, the effectiveness of the hedging strategy cannot be guaranteed. A potential mismatch in the\nbalance or duration of the hedging assumptions could lead to earnings deterioration if there are interest rate movements which are not\nadequately hedged. A decline in sterling interest rates may also compress net interest margins on retail portfolios. In addition, the Barclays\nBank UK Group\u2019s liquid asset portfolio is exposed to potential capital and/or income volatility due to movements in market rates and prices\nwhich may have a material adverse effect on the capital position of the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nFor further details on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s approach to treasury and capital risk, refer to the treasury and capital risk management\nand treasury and capital risk performance sections.\niv) Operational risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss to the Barclays Bank UK Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to\nexternal events where the root cause is not due to credit or market risks. Examples include:\na) Operational resilience\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group functions in a highly competitive market, with customers and clients that expect consistent and smooth\nbusiness processes. The loss of or disruption to business processing is a material inherent risk within the Barclays Bank UK Group and\nacross the financial services industry, which has impacted the Barclays Bank UK Group in the past and may continue to impact the Barclays\nBank UK Group in the future, whether arising through failures in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s technology systems, cyber and/or data\nintegrity disruptions, unavailability of a Barclays Bank UK Group site, or unavailability of personnel or services supplied by third parties. A\nchallenge for the Barclays Bank UK Group, as for virtually all companies, is the ability to recover from and remain within impact tolerance\nfor a pervasive cyberattack which impacts a number of applications, data and infrastructure services. Failure to build resilience and\nrecovery capabilities into business processes, or into the services on which the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business processes depend, may\nresult in significant customer harm, costs to reimburse losses incurred by the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s customers and clients, and\nreputational damage. There are also risks associated with increasing regulatory focus and new developments on operational resilience,\nwhich are considered in risk factor (iv) \u2018Regulatory change agenda and impact on business model\u2019 above.\nb) Cyberattacks\nCyberattacks continue to be a global threat inherent across all industries, with the number and severity of attacks continuing to rise. The\nfinancial sector remains a primary target for cybercriminals, hostile nation states (including nation-state-sponsored groups), opportunists\nand hacktivists. The Barclays Bank UK Group experiences numerous attempts to compromise its cybersecurity protections. In 2024,\ncybersecurity incidents experienced by the Barclays Bank UK Group included distributed denial of service (DDoS), phishing, and credential\nstuffing.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks. Malicious actors, who are increasingly sophisticated in\ntheir methods, tactics, techniques and procedures, seek to steal money, gain unauthorised access to, destroy or manipulate data, and\ndisrupt operations. Further, some attacks may not be recognised or discovered until launched or after initial entry into the environment,\nsuch as novel or zero-day attacks that are launched before patches are available and defences can be readied. Other attacks may take\nadvantage of the window during which patching or the deployment of other defences is underway, but not yet complete. Malicious actors\nare also increasingly developing methods to avoid detection and alerting capabilities, including by employing counter-forensic tactics\nmaking response activities more difficult.\nCyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and target the Barclays Bank UK Group in numerous ways, including via the\nBarclays Bank UK Group's networks, systems, applications, devices, or parties such as service providers and other suppliers, counterparties,\nemployees, contractors, customers or clients, presenting the Barclays Bank UK Group with a vast and complex defence perimeter.\nMoreover, the Barclays Bank UK Group does not have direct control over the cybersecurity of the systems of its clients, customers,\ncounterparties and third party service providers and suppliers, limiting the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to effectively protect and\ndefend against certain threats. Some of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s third party service providers and suppliers have experienced\nsuccessful attempts to compromise their cybersecurity. These have included incidents resulting in the compromise of the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup's data and ransomware attacks that disrupted service providers\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operations and, in some cases, have had impacts on\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group's operations. Such cyberattacks are likely to continue. Many of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s agreements with\nthird parties include liability or indemnification provisions, but the Barclays Bank UK Group may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all,\nunder these provisions to adequately offset any losses or other adverse impacts the Barclays Bank UK Group may incur from third party\nincidents.\nInadequacies in, or failures in the adherence to, the Barclays Bank UK Group's cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls; failure to keep\npace with evolving technology; instances of employee negligence, recklessness, malfeasance, poor password management, or", "page_start": 52, "page_end": 53, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}
{"chunk_id": "Barclays_2024_41", "chunk_index": 41, "text": "visions, but the Barclays Bank UK Group may not be able to recover sufficiently, or at all,\nunder these provisions to adequately offset any losses or other adverse impacts the Barclays Bank UK Group may incur from third party\nincidents.\nInadequacies in, or failures in the adherence to, the Barclays Bank UK Group's cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls; failure to keep\npace with evolving technology; instances of employee negligence, recklessness, malfeasance, poor password management, or\nRisk review\nMaterial existing and emerging risks\nsusceptibility to social engineering; misconfigurations in technology and security infrastructure; authentication and access management\nlapses; imperfect control frameworks or operational effectiveness; and human, governance or technological error could also compromise\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to successfully prevent and defend against cyberattacks. Furthermore, certain legacy technologies that\nare at or approaching end-of-life may not be able to maintain acceptable levels of security. The Barclays Bank UK Group's assessment of its\ncybersecurity risk in 2024 highlighted an elevated cybersecurity risk profile, due to factors such as the onset of AI, which may be used to\nfacilitate increasingly sophisticated attacks, including AI-enabled social engineering; ongoing work to address areas in need of\nenhancement identified through cybersecurity testing; bad actors\u2019 increasing ability to elude our defences and take advantage of customer\nand employee behaviours in novel ways; and geopolitical turmoil that could impact the Barclays Bank UK Group directly, or indirectly\nthrough its critical suppliers or national infrastructure, including escalating conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\nCertain cybersecurity risks to the Barclays Bank UK Group may be unknown to management and therefore not fully accounted for in the\nBarclays Bank UK Group's cybersecurity assessments, strategy and programme priorities. For example, we continue to implement\nenhancements identified through cybersecurity testing and reviews in 2024.\nCommon types of cyberattacks include deployment of malware to obtain covert access to systems and data; ransomware attacks that\nrender systems and data unavailable through encryption and attempts to leverage business interruption or stolen data for extortion; novel\nor zero-day exploits; denial of service and distributed denial of service attacks; infiltration via business email compromise; social\nengineering, including phishing, vishing and smishing; automated attacks using botnets; third party customer, vendor, service provider and\nsupplier account takeover; malicious activity facilitated by an insider; and credential validation or stuffing attacks using login and password\npairs from unrelated breaches. A successful cyberattack of any type has the potential to cause serious harm to the Barclays Bank UK Group\nor its clients and customers, including exposure to potential contractual liability, claims, litigation, regulatory or other government action,\nloss of existing or potential customers, damage to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s brand and reputation, and other financial loss. The impact\nof a successful cyberattack is also likely to include operational consequences (such as unavailability of services, networks, systems, devices\nor data), remediation of which could come at significant cost. While Barclays Bank UK Group maintains insurance coverage that may,\nsubject to relevant retentions, cover certain types of losses related to cybersecurity incidents, such insurance coverage may be insufficient\nto cover all losses and may not take into account potential loss of business or other financial harm.\nRegulators worldwide continue to recognise cybersecurity as a systemic risk to financial markets and have highlighted the need for\nfinancial institutions to improve their monitoring and control of, and resilience to, cyberattacks. A successful cyberattack may, therefore,\nresult in significant fines and penalties to the Barclays Bank UK Group. In addition, any new regulatory measures introduced to mitigate\nthese risks are likely to result in increased technology and compliance costs for the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nc) New and emergent technology\nTechnology is fundamental to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business and the financial services industry. Technological advancements\npresent opportunities to develop new and innovative ways of doing business across the Barclays Bank UK Group, with new solutions being\ndeveloped both in-house and in association with third party companies. For example, the digitalisation of payment services and securities,\nas well as futures and options trading, increasingly occurring electronically, both on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s own systems and\nthrough other alternative systems, and becoming automated.\nThe rapid development in AI is another area the Barclays Bank UK Group is monitoring closely. This includes the identification of potential\nuse cases for responsible adoption of AI in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s own operations as well as managing the salient risks and other\nthreats third party usage of AI may pose, including with respect to intellectual property ownership and infringement, cybersecurity,\nantitrust and fraud. For example, while the Barclays Bank UK Group may use AI technologies in connection with the creation or\ndevelopment of various materials, including software code, the Barclays Bank UK Group may be unable to protect such materials with\ncopyrights or patents given the position of courts and intellectual property offices in the United States and in some other jurisdictions that\nhuman inventorship is required for patent protection of an AI-generated invention and human authorship is required for copyright\nprotection of an AI-generated work of authorship. This is still an evolving area of the law, which creates uncertainty that could impact the\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to obtain intellectual property protection in AI-generated inventions and works of authorship.\nIntroducing new forms of technology has the potential to increase inherent risk. Failure to evaluate, actively manage and closely monitor\nrisk during all phases of business development and implementation could introduce new vulnerabilities and security flaws and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nd) Fraud\nThe nature of fraud is wide-ranging and continues to evolve, as criminals seek opportunities to target the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s\nbusiness activities and exploit changes in customer behaviour and product and channel use (such as the increased use of digital products\nand enhanced online services). Fraud attacks vary, can be highly sophisticated, and can be orchestrated by organised crime groups or\nindividuals. Fraudsters use various techniques to target customers and colleagues directly (i.e. third party fraud) or Barclays Bank UK Group\ndirectly (i.e. first party fraud). In the UK, APP (Authorised Push Payment) scams are a growing fraud type where customers are deceived to\ntransfer funds from their accounts to bad actors. Fraud can also be committed by one or more employees and workers of an entity (i.e.\ninternal fraud) or may manifest as unauthorised trading fraud. The impact from fraud can lead to customer harm, financial losses to both\nBarclays Bank UK Group and its customers, loss of business, missed business opportunities and reputational damage, all of which could\nhave a material adverse impact on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\ne) Data management, information protection and AI\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group holds and processes large volumes of data, including personal information, financial data and other\nconfidential information, and the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing", "page_start": 53, "page_end": 54, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

This data could relate to: (i) the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s clients, customers, prospective clients and customers and their\nemployees; (ii) clients and customers of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s clients and customers and their employees (iii) the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s suppliers, counterparties and other external parties, and their employees; and (iv) the Group\u2019s employees and prospective\nemployees. This data may also be held and processed for the Barclays Bank UK Group by third-party vendors, partners, or suppliers which\ntherefore exposes the Barclays Bank UK Group to risks from vulnerabilities and non-compliance in its supply chain.\nData, including personal information, is subject to external as well as internal (whether intentional or accidental) security risks. Concerns\nregarding the effectiveness of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s measures to safeguard data, including personal information, or even the\nperception that those measures are inadequate, could expose the Barclays Bank UK Group to the risk of loss or unavailability of data or data\nintegrity issues and/or cause the Barclays Bank UK Group to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce the\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by the Barclays Bank UK Group to comply with applicable\nprivacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to potential contractual liability, claims, litigation, regulatory or other\ngovernment action (including significant regulatory fines) and require changes to certain operations or practices which could also inhibit\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to\ncustomers. Any of these events could damage the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s reputation, subject the Barclays Bank UK Group to material\nfines or other monetary penalties, make the Barclays Bank UK Group liable for the payment of compensatory damages, divert\nmanagement\u2019s time and attention, lead to enhanced regulatory oversight and otherwise materially adversely affect its business, results of\noperations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, increased adoption of AI technologies, which rely on the collection of large amounts of data, including personal information,\nand use of such data for training purposes, has led legislators in numerous jurisdictions to propose and adopt new laws addressing AI-\nrelated usage of personal information and data protection authorities around the world to adopt new and evolving interpretations of\nexisting data protection laws in light of such technology, in both cases, imposing specific obligations with respect to the processing of\npersonal information, including required notices, consents and opt-outs. These obligations may be burdensome and costly to comply with\nand may affect the ways in which the Barclays Bank UK Group can collect, process, or use personal information for AI technologies, thus\nnegatively impacting the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business. Further, there is increased risk of inadvertent disclosure of confidential\ninformation or personal information in connection with the utilisation of AI technologies, whether through AI model errors, data breaches,\nor other vulnerabilities, which may also result in stronger regulatory scrutiny, leading to legal and regulatory investigations and\nenforcement actions that could negatively impact the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, even if unfounded.\nFor further details on data protection regulation applicable to the Barclays Bank UK Group, refer to the supervision and regulation section.\nf) Processing errors\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s businesses are highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number\nof transactions, many of which are complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies. Given Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s diverse customer\nbase and the increase in volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, developing, maintaining and upgrading operational\nsystems and infrastructure becomes more challenging. The risk of systems or human error, including errors produced through the\nintegration of AI technologies, in connection with such transactions increases with these developments, as well as the potential\nconsequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering\nerrors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. As the Barclays Bank UK Group works to implement AI technologies into the\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s product and service offerings, these challenges may become more significant, as AI technologies give rise to risk\nof bias, errors and hallucinations which may impact the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to accurately execute, track or report transactions.\nThere can be no assurances that AI usage will enhance the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s product or services offerings, and any such errors or\ninaccuracies resulting from AI usage could result in competitive or reputational harm or increased legal liability. Furthermore, events that\nare wholly or partially beyond the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s control, such as a spike in transaction volume, could adversely affect the\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to process transactions or provide banking and payment services.\nProcessing errors could result in the Barclays Bank UK Group, among other things: (i) failing to provide information, services and liquidity to\nclients and counterparties in a timely manner; (ii) failing to settle and/or confirm transactions; (iii) causing funds transfers and/or other\ntransactions to be executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences; and (iv) adversely affecting financial markets. Any of\nthese events could materially disadvantage the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s customers, clients and counterparties (including them suffering\nfinancial loss) and/or result in a loss of confidence in the Barclays Bank UK Group which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any of these events could also lead to\nbreaches of laws, rules or regulations and, hence, regulatory enforcement actions, which could result in significant financial loss, imposition\nof additional capital requirements, enhanced regulatory supervision and reputational damage.\ng) Supplier exposure\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group depends on suppliers for the provision of many of its services and the development of technology, including AI\ntechnology. Whilst the Barclays Bank UK Group depends on suppliers, it remains fully accountable to its customers and clients for risks\narising from the actions of suppliers and may not be able to recover from its suppliers any amounts paid to customers and clients for losses\nsuffered by them. The dependency on suppliers and sub-contracting of outsourced services introduces concentration risk where the failure\nof specific suppliers could have an impact on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to continue to provide material services to its customers.\nIn addition, the use of third party AI technologies may also expose the Barclays Bank UK Group to third party infringement or\nmisappropriation claims, as well as privacy and data protection related claims, as it can be very difficult, if not impossible, to validate the\nprocesses used by third-party AI technology providers in their collection and use of data in developing and training AI technologies or the\nconversion of inputs to outputs. Failure to adequately manage supplier risk could have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.", "page_start": 54, "page_end": 55, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Failure to adequately manage supplier risk could have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisk review\nMaterial existing and emerging risks\nh) Estimates and judgements relating to critical accounting policies and regulatory disclosures\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies and judgements to be made in accordance with\nIFRS. Regulatory returns and capital disclosures are prepared in accordance with the relevant capital reporting and liquidity requirements\nand also require assumptions and estimates to be made. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas\nwhere assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements and regulatory returns and disclosures, include\ncredit impairment provisions fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, the calculation of RWAs, capital and\nliquidity metrics, and provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters (please refer to the notes to the audited\nfinancial statements for further details). There is a risk that if the judgement exercised, or the estimates or assumptions used, subsequently\nturn out to be incorrect or are altered as a result of assurance work or subsequent feedback from the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s regulators,\nthis could result in material losses to the Barclays Bank UK Group, beyond what was anticipated or provided for, including as a result of\nchanges to treatments or stated capital or liquidity in regulatory returns and capital and liquidity disclosures. If capital and liquidity\nrequirements are not met as a result of changes in interpretation, compliance with the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s distribution policy could\nbe impacted and/or additional measures may be required to strengthen the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s capital or leverage position, which\nmay also lead to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s inability to achieve stated targets. Further development of accounting standards and\nregulatory interpretations could also materially impact the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and\nprospects.\ni) Tax risk\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group is required to comply with the tax laws and practice of all countries in which it has business operations. There\nis a risk that the Barclays Bank UK Group could suffer losses due to additional tax charges, other financial costs or reputational damage as a\nresult of failing to comply with such laws and practice (including where the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s interpretation of such laws differs\nfrom the interpretation of tax authorities), or by failing to manage its tax affairs in an appropriate manner. In addition, increasing tax\nauthority focus on customer tax reporting requirements for UK and international customers and the digitalisation of the administration of\ntax has potential to increase the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s tax compliance obligations further. In 2023, the UK Government enacted\nlegislation on the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar Two Framework introducing a global minimum tax\nrate of 15%. The UK\u2019s Pillar Two rules applied from 1 January 2024 and increased the Barclays Bank UK Group's tax compliance obligations.\nThis tax regime requires systems and process changes that introduce potential additional operational risks.\nj) Ability to hire and retain appropriately qualified employees\nAs a regulated financial institution, the Barclays Bank UK Group requires diversified and specialist skilled colleagues. The Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse mix of talent is key to the delivery of its core business activity and strategy. This is\nimpacted by a range of external and internal factors, such as macroeconomic factors, labour, immigration and related policies in the\njurisdiction in which the Barclays Bank UK Group operates, and regulatory limits on compensation for senior executives. Failure to attract or\nprevent the departure of appropriately qualified and skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, this may result in disruption to service which could\nin turn lead to customer harm and reputational damage.\nFor further details on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s approach to operational risk, refer to the operational risk management and operational\nrisk performance sections.\nv) Model risk\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. The\nBarclays Bank UK Group relies on models to support a broad range of business and risk management activities, including informing\nbusiness decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures (including the calculation of impairment), conducting\nstress testing, calculating RWAs and assessing capital adequacy, supporting new business acceptance, risk and reward evaluation,\nmanaging client assets, and meeting reporting requirements.\nModels are imperfect representations of reality as they rely on simplifying assumptions; as such they are subject to intrinsic uncertainty as\nwell as errors and inappropriate use. This may be exacerbated when dealing with unprecedented scenarios, as was the case during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, when simplifying assumptions were required due to the lack of reliable historical reference points and data. Model\nuncertainty, errors and inappropriate use may result in (among other things) the Barclays Bank UK Group making inappropriate business\ndecisions and/or inaccuracies or errors in the Barclays Bank UK Group's risk management and regulatory reporting processes. This could\nresult in a significant financial loss, imposition of additional capital requirements, enhanced regulatory supervision and reputational\ndamage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and prospects.\nFor further details on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s approach to model risk, refer to the model risk management and model risk\nperformance sections.\nvi) Compliance Risk\nCompliance Risk is the risk of poor outcomes for, or harm to, customers, clients and markets, arising from the delivery of the Barclays Bank\nUK\u2019s products and services (conduct risk) and the risk to Barclays Bank UK Group, its clients, customers or markets from a failure to comply\nwith the laws, rules and regulations (LRR) applicable to the firm (LRR risk).

This risk could manifest itself in a variety of ways, including:\nRisk review\nMaterial existing and emerging risks\na) Market conduct\nThe Barclays Bank UK businesses are exposed to risk from potential non-compliance with its policies and standards (which incorporates\nregulatory requirements set by law and the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s regulators) and instances of wilful and negligent misconduct by\nemployees, all of which could result in potential customer and client harm, enforcement action (including regulatory fines and/or\nsanctions), increased operation and compliance costs, redress or remediation or reputational damage which in turn could have a material\nadverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK business, financial condition and prospects. Examples of employee misconduct which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK business include: (i) improperly selling or marketing the Barclays Bank UK products and\nservices; (ii) engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or anti-competitive or collusive behaviour (iii) misappropriating confidential\nor proprietary information belonging to Barclays Bank UK, its customers or third parties. These risks may be exacerbated in circumstances\nwhere the Barclays Bank UK is unable to rely on physical oversight and supervision of employees, noting the move to a hybrid working\nmodel for many colleagues.\nb) Customer protection\nThe Barclays Bank UK must ensure that its customers, particularly those that are vulnerable, are able to make well-informed decisions on\nhow best to use the Barclays Bank UK financial services and understand the protection available to them if something goes wrong. Poor\ncustomer outcomes can result from the failure to: (i) communicate fairly and clearly with customers; (ii) provide services in a timely and fair\nmanner; (iii) handle and protect customer data appropriately; (iv) undertake appropriate activity to address customer harm, including the\nadherence to regulatory and legal requirements on complaint handling: and (v) provide fair value for the product. Barclays Bank UK is at\nrisk of financial loss and reputational damage, and also at risk of regulatory censure or enforcement action resulting from failure to manage\nand oversee customer outcomes and fully embed compliance with Consumer Duty requirements.\nc) Product design and review risk\nProducts and services must meet the needs of clients, customers, markets and the Barclays Bank UK throughout their life cycle. However,\nthere is a risk that the design and review of the Barclays Bank UK\u2019s products and services fail to reasonably consider and address potential\nor actual negative outcomes for customers, which may result in customer harm, enforcement action (including regulatory fines and/or\nsanctions), redress and remediation and reputational damage. Both the design and review of products and services are a key area of focus\nfor regulators and the Barclays Bank UK.\nd) Conflicts of interest\nIdentifying and managing conflicts of interest is fundamental to the conduct of Barclays Bank UK business, relationships with customers,\nand the markets in which the Barclays Bank UK operates. Understanding the conflicts of interest that impact or potentially impact the\nBarclays Bank UK enables them to be identified, managed and mitigated appropriately. Even if there is no evidence of improper actions, a\nconflict of interest can create an appearance of impropriety that undermines confidence in the Barclays Bank UK Group and its employees.\nIf the Barclays Bank UK does not identify and manage conflicts of interest (business or personal) appropriately, it could have an adverse\neffect on the Barclays Bank UK\u2019s business, customers and the markets within which it operates.\ne) Regulatory focus on culture and accountability\nRegulators around the world continue to emphasise the importance of culture and personal accountability and enforce the adoption of\nadequate internal reporting and whistleblowing procedures to help to promote appropriate conduct and drive positive outcomes for\ncustomers, colleagues, clients and markets. The requirements and expectations of the UK Senior Managers Regime, Certification Regime\nand Conduct Rules reinforce additional accountabilities for individuals across the Barclays Bank UK with an increased focus on governance\nand rigour. Failure to meet these requirements and expectations may lead to regulatory sanctions, both for the individuals and the Barclays\nBank UK.\nf) Laws, rules and regulations\nBarclays is subject to a range of laws, rules and regulations. A failure to comply with these may have an adverse effect on the Barclays Bank\nUK\u2019s business, customers and the markets within which it operates and could result in reputational damage, penalties, damages or fines.\nFor further details on the Barclays Bank UK\u2019s approach to Compliance Risk, refer to the compliance risk management and compliance risk\nperformance sections.\nvii)Reputation risk\nReputation risk is the risk that an action, transaction, investment, event, decision or business relationship will reduce trust in the Barclays\nBank UK Group\u2019s integrity and/or competence.\nAny material lapse in standards of integrity, compliance, customer service or operating efficiency may represent a potential reputation risk.\nStakeholder expectations constantly evolve, and so reputation risk is dynamic and varies between geographical regions, groups and\nindividuals. A risk arising in one business area can have an adverse effect upon the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s overall reputation and any\none transaction, investment or event (in the perception of key stakeholders) can reduce trust in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s integrity and\ncompetence. The Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s association with sensitive topics and sectors has been, and in some instances continues to be,\nan area of concern for stakeholders, including: (i) the financing of, and investments in, businesses which operate in sectors that are\nsensitive because of their relative carbon intensity or local environmental impact; (ii) potential association with human rights violations", "page_start": 56, "page_end": 57, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Modern technologies, in\nparticular online social media channels and other broadcast tools that facilitate communication with large audiences in short time frames\nand with minimal costs, may significantly enhance and accelerate the distribution and effect of damaging information and allegations.\nNegative public opinion may adversely affect the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ability to retain and attract customers, in particular, corporate\nand retail depositors, and to retain and motivate staff. It could also have a material adverse effect on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Claims of potential greenwashing arising from sustainability-related\nstatements made by the Barclays Group may also give rise to reputation risk.\nIn addition to the above, reputation risk has the potential to arise from operational issues or conduct matters which cause harm to\ncustomers, clients, market integrity, effective competition or the Barclays Bank UK Group (refer to \u2018iv) Operational risk\u2019 above).\nFor further details on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s approach to reputation risk, refer to the reputation risk management and reputation\nrisk performance sections.\nviii)Legal risk and legal, competition and regulatory matters\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group conducts diverse activities in a highly regulated global market which exposes it and its employees to legal risk\narising from: (i) the multitude of laws, rules and regulations that apply to the activities it undertakes, which are highly dynamic and may be\nunclear in their application to particular circumstances especially in new and emerging areas; and (ii) the diversified and evolving nature of\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s businesses and business practices. In each case, this exposes the Barclays Bank UK Group and its employees\nto the risk of loss or the imposition of penalties, damages or fines from the failure of members of the Barclays Bank UK Group to meet\napplicable laws, rules, regulations or contractual requirements or to assert or defend their intellectual property rights. Legal risk may arise in\nrelation to any number of the material existing and emerging risks identified above.\nA breach of applicable laws, rules and/or regulations by the Barclays Bank UK Group or its employees could result in criminal prosecution,\nregulatory censure, potentially significant fines, remedial orders and other sanctions. Where clients, customers or other third parties are\nharmed by the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s conduct, this may also give rise to civil legal proceedings, including class actions. Other legal\ndisputes may also arise between the Barclays Bank UK Group and third parties relating to matters such as breaches or enforcement of legal\nrights or obligations arising under contracts, statutes or common law. Adverse findings in any such matters may result in the Barclays Bank\nUK Group being liable to third parties or may result in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s rights not being enforced or not being enforced in the\nmanner intended or desired by the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nAlthough the Barclays Bank UK Group never operated in the motor finance market in the UK, the wider financial industry may be impacted\nby the October 2024 Court of Appeal judgments on commission arrangements in the motor finance industry, subject to the result of the\nappeals of those judgments to the Supreme Court, and to the FCA\u2019s ongoing review of the motor finance market. In December 2024, the\nFCA announced an extension to the time motor finance firms have to handle complaints on lender commissions until after 4 December\n2025, following on from the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments in Johnson v FirstRand Bank, Wrench v FirstRand Bank and Hopcroft v Close\nBrothers Ltd [2024] EWCA Civ 1282. The decisions in these cases could, subject to these appeals, impact the availability and terms of\nfinancing, risk of future claims, and likelihood of a FCA consumer redress scheme. There could also be wider market and industry\nimplications of the judgments and/or the appeals, which could adversely affect the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and prospects.\nFurther details of legal, competition and regulatory matters to which the Barclays Bank UK Group is currently exposed are set out in Note\n24. In addition to matters specifically described in Note 24, the Barclays Bank UK Group is engaged in various other legal proceedings which\narise in the ordinary course of business. The Barclays Bank UK Group is also subject to requests for information, investigations and other\nreviews (including skilled person reviews) by regulators, governmental and other public bodies. These may be in connection with business\nactivities in which the Barclays Bank UK Group is, or has been, engaged, or areas of particular regulatory focus, such as financial crime,\nmoney laundering or terrorist financing. The Barclays Bank UK Group may also (from time to time) be subject to claims and/or legal\nproceedings and other investigations relating to financial and non-financial disclosures made by members of the Barclays Bank UK Group\n(including, but not limited to, regulatory capital and liquidity reporting and ESG disclosures). Additionally, due to the increasing number of\nnew climate and sustainability-related laws and regulations, growing demand from investors and customers for sustainable products and\nservices, and regulatory and NGO scrutiny, financial institutions, including the Barclays Bank UK Group, may through their business\nactivities face increasing litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks related to climate change, environmental degradation\nand other social, governance and sustainability-related issues. In particular, there has been an increasing focus on greenwashing risk this\nyear. Certain stakeholders have taken legal action (including under \u201csoft law\u201d mechanisms) against the Barclays Bank UK Group, and others\n(including regulators, campaign groups and customers) may decide to do so in the future for allegedly financing or contributing to climate\nchange, environmental degradation and other social, governance and sustainability-related issues, or because the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup's response to climate change or other ESG factors is perceived to be ineffective, insufficient or inappropriate, including relative to the\nBarclays Bank UK Group's stated ambitions. Furthermore, there are laws and regulatory processes and policies seeking to restrict or prohibit\ndoing certain business with entities identified as \"boycotting\" or \"discriminating\" against particular industries or considering ESG factors in\ntheir investment processes, including to protect the energy and other high carbon sectors from any risks of divestment or challenges in\naccessing finance.\nThe outcome of legal, competition and regulatory matters, both those to which the Barclays Bank UK Group is currently exposed and any\nothers which may arise in the future, is difficult to predict (and any provision made in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s financial statements", "page_start": 57, "page_end": 58, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

The Barclays Bank UK Group is subject to numerous laws and regulations\ngoverning these areas, including certain \u201cfailure to prevent\u201d offences whereby the Barclays Bank UK Group may be liable for failure to\nprevent crimes carried out by persons associated with it.\nBribery and corruption occur where a person improperly obtains or retains business, improperly secures a business or personal advantage\nand induces another person to perform their role in breach of an expectation of good faith, impartiality, or trust. Risks related to bribery and\ncorruption may arise for the Barclays Bank UK Group in connection with (i) employees/prospective employees who have connections to\nexternal stakeholders, Politically Exposed Persons, or public officials; (ii) different types of payments and expenses such as facilitation\npayment requests, gifts and entertainment, charitable donations, commercial sponsorships and political donations; (iii) certain types of\nfunding provided to customers with increased exposure to public officials; (iv) third parties who are engaged by the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup to win or retain business; (v) the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s proprietary investments, joint ventures and mergers and acquisition or\n(vi) suppliers who act for and on behalf of the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing have been identified as major threats to the international financial services community and\ntherefore to the Barclays Bank UK Group. The Barclays Bank UK Group must comply globally with UK legislation designed to prevent, detect\nand disrupt money laundering and to combat terrorism. As a transatlantic bank, the Barclays Group also takes into account European\nUnion (EU) and United States (US) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing requirements, as well as guidance issued by\nbodies such as the Wolfsberg Group and the European Banking Authority.\nTax evasion is a financial crime and a predicate offence to money laundering in the UK and in many other countries in which we operate.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group may be exposed to risks associated with tax evasion by virtue of its interactions with customers and clients or\nin connection with employees or third parties acting on our behalf.\nAs a global financial institution, the Barclays Bank UK Group must comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations in every\njurisdiction in which it operates, or which apply to it because of its place of incorporation. Sanctions restrict activities with targeted\ncountries, governments, entities, individuals, and industries.\nThe laws and regulations associated with financial crime risks can have broad application and, in certain circumstances, may have\nextraterritorial application. Failure to appropriately manage the risks associated with these four areas undermines market integrity and may\nresult in harm to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s clients, customers, counterparties or employees, diminished confidence in financial\nproducts and services, damage to the Barclays Bank UK Group's reputation, regulatory breaches and/or financial penalties.", "page_start": 58, "page_end": 59, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Physical risks can be event driven\n(acute risks), including increased frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes and flood. Longer\nterm shifts in climate patterns (chronic risks) arise from sustained higher temperatures that may cause rises in sea levels, rising mean\ntemperatures and more severe weather events such as increased occurrence of floods or fires.\nTransition risk: is defined as the risk of financial losses caused by extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes to address\nmitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change.\nOverview\nThe physical and transition risks of climate change have the potential to drive other Principal Risks. For Barclays Bank UK Group, the\nimpacts of climate risks are most pronounced in our \u2018elevated\u2019 portfolios, UK Mortgages and Business Banking Agriculture, through credit\nrisk. These portfolios are therefore the primary focus for scenario analysis and carbon modelling within Barclays Bank UK Group. In the UK\nMortgages portfolio this could materialise as impacts to affordability (i.e. through damage caused by flooding, or high insurance\npremiums) and devaluation of house prices (i.e. due to poor energy efficiency). Within Business Banking Agriculture, physical risks have the\npotential to drive declines in yield, whilst transition risks such as emissions taxation have the potential to increase costs, both impacting\nprofitability.\nGiven the significance of climate change, and to support the Barclays Group\u2019s ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, Climate Risk is a\nPrincipal Risk under Barclays\u2019 ERMF.\nThe Barclays Group has developed a Climate Risk Framework (CRF) for financial and operational risks stemming from climate change. This\nenables Barclays to foster a consistent approach for managing climate risk across the firm. The key principle underpinning this framework\nis that climate risk is recognised as a driver of other existing financial (Credit, Market, Treasury and Capital) and non-financial (including\nOperational) risks, and not treated as a standalone risk type. The CRF is supported by policies, standards and other relevant guidelines\nwhich contain control objectives that must be met.\nThe Climate Risk Framework:\n\u2022 Includes definitions and descriptions for climate risk\n\u2022 Includes key principles for the identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting of climate risk\n\u2022 Outlines the approach to setting risk appetite for climate risk\n\u2022 Outlines roles and responsibilities applicable to the Climate Risk Framework\nThe Climate Risk Policy sets out high level requirements and control objectives to address key principles articulated in the CRF. The Climate\nRisk Standard sets out control requirements for implementing control objectives defined within the Climate Risk Policy. Climate risk\nconsiderations have also been incorporated as applicable to the frameworks of other principal risks.\nThe Climate Risk Framework, Climate Risk Policy and Climate Risk Standard are applicable for Barclays' business activities, with a focus on\nlending, capital markets and investments. Barclays\u2019 approach to managing climate risk focuses on the effective, identification, prioritisation\nand mitigation of the material climate risks with Barclays\u2019 portfolios. The approach is customised to reflect portfolio characteristics, size and\nexposure to specific climate risk drivers within various portfolios.\nClimate risk may also drive non-financial risks such as reputational risk, which continue to be managed under their respective risk\nframeworks.\nTo implement its Climate Risk Framework, Barclays continuously implements new processes, tools, models and data repository as\napplicable whilst also enhancing its existing ones. The Group regularly reviews its approach and practices for alignment with regulatory\ndevelopments and leading practices for climate risk.\nOrganisation, Roles & Responsibilities\nThe Barclays Group Head of Climate Risk is the Principal Risk owner accountable for the management and oversight of the climate risk\nprofile.

Additionally, Climate Risk assurance groups are responsible for performing climate risk specific reviews to support the\nembedding of the Climate Risk Framework.\nRisk Appetite\nBarclays\u2019 approach to setting risk appetite for climate risk is aligned to its ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and reducing financed\nemissions in line with 2030 financed emissions targets. Barclays has established a risk appetite for climate risk at the Group level. The\nclimate risk considerations have been included in the qualitative statements and quantitative constraints. This is reviewed and revised\n(where applicable) annually and formally approved by the Board.\nClimate risk appetite is managed through limits, triggers and indicators set across different Principal Risks (including Credit Risk, Market\nRisk and Treasury & Capital Risk), portfolios, sectors, assets classes and products. Barclays has progressively enhanced its approach for the\nquantification of climate risk appetite by implementing additional risk limits and triggers. Regular monitoring, reporting and governance\nprovide oversight so that exposures remain within the appetite and corrective actions are taken to address any breaches or excesses. The\nGroup continues to regularly review its risk appetite and makes enhancements to maintain alignment with the Group's strategic objectives\nas part of its business planning process. The Climate Risk Appetite Constraint requires that financed emissions are managed in line with\ndisclosed targets. Barclays Bank UK came into scope of the Climate Risk Appetite Constraint in Q1 2024 following the announcement of the\nBlueTrack Dairy and Livestock sector financed emissions target. Barclays Bank UK were tested against, and passed, the Climate Risk\nAppetite Constraint in late 2024.

Barclays Bank UK came into scope of the Climate Risk Appetite Constraint in Q1 2024 following the announcement of the\nBlueTrack Dairy and Livestock sector financed emissions target. Barclays Bank UK were tested against, and passed, the Climate Risk\nAppetite Constraint in late 2024. Alongside regular monitoring of the Dairy & Livestock sector\u2019s financed emissions, Barclays Bank UK has\nintroduced key risk indicators and limits to manage risk and track progress towards our targets.\nRisk review\nPrincipal risk management\nRisk Identification\nPhysical and transition risk drivers can lead to adverse financial impacts through various transmission channels. Transmission channels are\ncausal chains that explain how climate risk drivers impact firms such as the Barclays Bank Group, either directly through their own\noperations and infrastructure or indirectly through their financing and investment activities. Through these transmission channels, risks for\nBarclays may materialise in its traditional risk categories such as credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, and operational risk. The\nimpact of climate risk drivers may be significant and widespread, affecting companies, households and the general economy leading to\npotential financial system contagion.\nBarclays' work on assessing climate-related risks have been focused on the short (0-1 year) and medium term (1-5 years) horizons, in line\nwith our financial planning cycle. The longer-term climate (> 5years) risks have been considered using both quantitative approaches, such\nas reverse stress testing, and qualitative analysis. The effects of climate risk drivers through macro and micro transmissions channels are\nobserved in Barclays' portfolio through traditional risk categories such as credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, operational risk\n(including legal risk). The below table provides examples of how Barclays' Climate Risk framework considers potential key effects of\nclimate risk drivers on Barclays' Principal Risk types.\nPrincipal risk Example effects of climate risk drivers\nCredit risk A changing climate (i.e. more frequent and more intense physical hazards) and society\u2019s response (i.e.\nincreased transition factors such as new policies or technologies to reduce carbon emissions) impacts\nCredit Risk. The impact on Credit Risk relates to the failure of clients, customers or counterparties to meet\ntheir obligations as a result of physical and transition risks, which may lead to potential losses and/or\nexposures outside the bank risk appetite in retail and wholesale credit portfolios. Climate change can drive\ndirect impacts such as damage to fixed assets from physical hazards, leading to changes in output and\nincreased costs. Indirect impacts may include material disruptions to supply chains and shifting demand for\ngoods and services. Transition factors such as low-carbon policies or technologies could also change the\nvalue and creditworthiness of counterparties clients and customers.\nMarket risk The impact on Market Risk relates to potential adverse changes in the value of the firm's assets and liabilities\nfrom fluctuations in market variables as a result of physical and transition risks, which may lead to potential\nlosses due to changes in equity and commodity prices and credit spreads. Either physical hazards or\ntransition risk factors have the potential to trigger large, sudden and negative price adjustments where\nclimate risk has not yet been incorporated into prices, driving additional Market Risk. Fluctuations in\nmarkets and prices in susceptible sectors or countries could drive losses to the value of the Bank\u2019s assets\nand liabilities.\nTreasury & capital risk The impact on Treasury & Capital Risk relates to the impact on the capital requirements and liquidity\nfunding requirements as a result of physical and transition risks, which may lead to changes in capital plans,\nfunding plan requirements, asset and liabilities management (ALM) and exposures to changes in interest\nrates. Climate events can drive Treasury & Capital Risk as counterparties draw down deposits and credit\nlines. Physical hazards, or transition factors could lead to increased volatility which could in turn change the\nvalue of investments and drive changes to funding requirements and accessibility, capital planning, capital\nrequirements, or hedging methodologies.\nOperational risk Physical hazards and transition risk factors can lead to impacts on the firm\u2019s own operations including\ndamage or unsuitability of premises, disruption to business operations and supply chain and ability to\nrecover from outages (e.g. caused by workforce, technology and third-party service providers). For example,\nextreme weather events can impact the operation of bank offices, branches, and support facilities such as\ndata centres. The transition to a low-carbon economy can lead to changes in operational processes, for\nexample to mitigate climate impacts we need to decarbonise our buildings or requirements to achieve more\ncarbon efficient buildings. Transition risks can also drive secondary impacts on operational risks such as the\nrisk of misreporting as a result of enhanced regulatory disclosures requirements, or physical security\nbreaches and branch closures as a result of protests related to Barclays\u2019 lending activities.\nBarclays\u2019 climate risk identification includes monitoring of the external environment including regulatory developments, climate-related\nlitigations and market developments for identifying climate risk drivers that could affect Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s portfolios. In addition to\nhorizon scanning, Barclays has also developed processes to identify sectors which other Principal Risks must prioritise for further analysis\nand risk management activities. Following this assessment, the industry sectors that are highly exposed to climate risks are deemed to be\nof elevated risk. These assessments are regularly reviewed and benchmarked against external studies and research and incorporate inputs\nfrom the subject matter experts.\nIn the UK Retail and Business Banking portfolios, Barclays is using both internal and external data sources to identify portfolio segments\nthat are vulnerable to subsidence and flood risks. Additionally, Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings have been identified for\nportfolios that are particularly vulnerable to transition risk. Methodology and breakdown of exposure to these risks is available on page 71.\nRisk Assessment\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group uses its Risk Register process to assess the potential effects of climate risk drivers on its portfolios. The\nBarclays Bank UK Group Risk Register contains key risks that may impact forward-looking business plans across Barclays Bank UK Group.\nThe materiality of climate risks is derived either quantitatively (typically based on stress testing) or through qualitative estimations. The\npotential impact is evaluated based on adverse but plausible scenario. The Barclays Bank UK Risk Register is refreshed on at least an annual\nbasis and is subsequently used to support strategic planning, risk management, scenario design, sensitivity analysis and capital adequacy\nassessments.", "page_start": 61, "page_end": 62, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Barclays Bank UK also implemented an enhanced Climate & Environment\nLens questionnaire for clients in elevated climate risk sectors.\nAcross Barclays' portfolios, scenario analysis continues to form a key part of the Group\u2019s approach to assessing and quantifying the impact\nof climate change. In 2024, Barclays Bank UK Group was included in the Internal Stress Test, a single scenario was designed to assess\nBarclays' financial resiliency to both climate and traditional macroeconomic risk\u2013 and the extent to which Barclays would remain within risk\nappetite. Additionally, Climate factors were incorporated into a climate-based Reverse Stress Test (RST). The climate-based RST assessed\nboth transition and physical climate risks, over a longer term horizon to understand the impact from more extreme tail events, and better\nunderstand the plausible triggers that could lead to these events unfolding sooner, or that Barclays Bank UK Group should monitor to\nprevent such losses. For further detail on scenario analysis, please see the Scenario Analysis section of the Climate and Sustainability report,\nClient Level Assessment\nAt a client level, the Climate & Environment Lens questionnaire is used to evaluate physical, transition and environmental risks associated\nwith the firms operating in elevated risk sectors. During 2024, the evaluation method and the scoring criteria associated with the Climate &\nEnvironment Lens has been enhanced to deliver more accurate and improved materiality assessments. The questionnaire is completed by\nthe Barclays Bank UK banking teams, with data collected from conversations with clients. Each question is rated as Low, Moderate or High\nbased on the client\u2019s exposure and vulnerability to various climate and environmental risk factors. The final rating is based on scoring from\nall questions but not mechanically linked to them.\nThe Agriculture Net Zero Forum was established to review all new lending or refinancing requests over a certain threshold from clients in\nthe Dairy and Cattle sectors. The review is focused on the clients\u2019 plans to adapt and transition to a low-carbon economy and a\nrecommendation is made for further lending decisions. As of 2024, it is a requirement that the Client Transition Tool form is completed for\nclients in Dairy & Cattle sectors for all new or refinanced lending. This allows Barclays Bank UK Group to enhance our understanding of the\ntransition risk profiles of clients in these sectors.\nCapital & Liquidity Risk Assessment\nFor Treasury and Capital Risk (TCR), climate risk considerations have also been incorporated into the Internal Capital Adequacy\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) and Liquidity Adequacy assessment Process (ILAAP). Barclays has integrated climate risk variables and\nclimate stress scenarios in the Group-wide internal stress testing framework to understand and quantify potential impact on Barclays'\ncapital position. For liquidity risk, the assessment is informed by the application of industry and country classifications and evaluated using\ninternal stress testing and portfolio specific analysis to determine material areas of risk (e.g. by asset class or product type) that could\nimpact funding and liquidity ratios. For Pension Risk, key risk indicators based on the impact of physical and transition risk drivers on the\npension fund have been defined. These are reviewed and monitored on a quarterly basis.\nOperational Risk Assessment\nFor operational risk, climate-related risks continue to be assessed as part of existing business-as-usual operational risk processes. This\nincludes working with Premises and Operational Recovery Planning teams to evaluate and respond to climate-related impacts and\nregulatory requirements. Climate factors have been integrated into Structured Scenario Assessments, which capture extreme but plausible\noperational tail risks.\nRisk Monitoring and Reporting\nBarclays' monitoring approach for climate risk is designed to track climate-related exposures across portfolios, leveraging risk metrics,\nlatest insights and periodic assessments for alignment with risk appetite and climate goals.\nMandate & scale\nMandate & scale exposure controls translate risk appetite into a detailed series of limits to control day-to-day risk taking. Barclays has\nimplemented climate-aware limits and controls for priority sectors, including BlueTrack\u2122 measures of emissions intensity. For Barclays\nBank UK Group, physical and transition risk mandates are in place for the UK Mortgages and Business Banking Agriculture portfolios.\nBarclays UK Climate Risk Dashboard\nThe Barclays UK Climate Risk Dashboard contains quantitative metrics on the climate risk profile of Barclays Bank UK Group portfolios. The\nBarclays UK Climate Risk Dashboard is reviewed at the Barclays UK Climate Risk Forum & Barclays UK Risk Committee on a quarterly basis.\nThis is used to inform progress against sector targets, current exposure to portfolios with high physical and transition risks, concentrations,\ntrends across industry sectors, portfolios and regions.

In the Barclays Bank UK Group, business risk committees (attended by the\nfirst line) monitor and review the credit risk profile of each business unit where the most material issues are escalated to the Retail Credit\nRisk Management Committee, Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee and Barclays UK Risk Committee.\nWholesale and retail portfolios are managed separately to reflect the differing nature of the assets; wholesale balances tend to be larger and\nare managed on an individual basis, while retail balances are greater in number but lesser in value and are, therefore, managed in\naggregated segments.\nThe responsibilities of the credit risk management teams in the businesses, the sanctioning team and other shared services include:\nsanctioning new credit agreements; setting strategies for approval of transactions (principally retail); setting risk appetite; monitoring risk\nagainst limits and other parameters; setting recession readiness frameworks to protect portfolios in the event of economic stress,\nmaintaining robust processes, data gathering, quality, storage and reporting methods for effective credit risk management; performing\neffective turnaround and workout scenarios for wholesale portfolios via dedicated restructuring and recoveries teams and maintaining\nrobust collections and recovery processes/units for retail portfolios. The credit risk management teams in the Barclays Bank UK Group are\naccountable to the Barclays Bank UK Group CRO who, in turn, reports to the Barclays Group CRO.\nFor wholesale portfolios, credit risk managers are organised in sanctioning teams by client portfolio. In the wholesale portfolios, credit risk\napproval is undertaken by experienced credit risk professionals operating within a clearly defined delegated authority framework, with only\nthe most senior credit officers entrusted with the higher levels of delegated authority. The largest credit exposures require the support of\nthe Barclays Bank UK PLC Senior Credit Officer. For exposures in excess of the Barclays Bank UK PLC Senior Credit Officer\u2019s authority,\napproval by the Barclays Bank UK PLC CRO is also required. Where exposures are also of Barclays Group level significance, the Barclays\nGroup Credit Risk Committee, attended by the Barclays Bank UK PLC Senior Credit Officer, provides a formal mechanism for the Barclays\nGroup Senior Credit Officer to exercise the highest level of credit authority.\nCredit risk mitigation\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group employs a range of techniques and strategies to actively mitigate credit risks. These can broadly be divided\ninto three types:\n\u25aa netting and set-off\n\u25aa collateral\n\u25aa risk transfer\nNetting and set-off\nCredit risk exposures can be reduced by applying netting and set-off.

Contingent leverage risk is managed by; i) setting comprehensive leverage (and RWA) targets for each business as part of\nthe Treasury capital management process, taking into account adherence to early warning indicators and maintain a healthy leverage ratio,\nand; ii) Monitoring execution of actions taken to course-correct as necessary.\nBarclays Bank UK PLC is a participating employer in the UK Retirement Fund (UKRF), whose assets and liabilities are currently held on the\nBarclays Bank PLC balance sheet. It is Barclays intention to sectionalise the UKRF in July 2025, with Barclays Bank UK PLC employees\nmoving to one section and other members in a separate section. Until that date, the nature of pension risk for Barclays Bank UK PLC is\ncontingent, specifically on a Barclays Bank PLC default. Refer to Note 28 Staff Costs for further detail.\nInterest rate risk in the banking book management (IRRBB)\nOverview\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is driven by customer deposit taking and lending activities, investments in the liquid asset portfolio\nand funding activities. As per the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s policy to remain within the defined risk appetite, hedging strategies are\nexecuted to mitigate the various IRRBB risks that result from these activities. However, the Barclays Bank UK Group remains susceptible to\ninterest rate risk and other non-traded market risks from the following key sources:\n\u25aa Interest rate and repricing risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by a change in interest rates, differences in\nthe timing of interest rate changes between assets and liabilities, and other constraints on interest rate changes as per product terms and\nconditions.\n\u25aa Customer behavioural risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by the discretion that customers and\ncounterparties may have in respect of being able to vary from their contractual obligations with the Barclays Bank UK Group. This risk is\noften referred to by industry regulators as \u2018embedded option risk\u2019.\n\u25aa Investment risks in the liquid asset portfolio: the risk that the fair value of assets held in the liquid asset portfolio and associated risk\nmanagement portfolios could be adversely impacted by market volatility, creating volatility in capital directly.\nOrganisation, roles and responsibilities\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group ALCO, together with the Barclays Group Treasury Committee, are responsible for monitoring and managing\nIRRBB risk in line with the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s management objectives and risk frameworks. The Barclays UK Risk Committee and\nTreasury and Capital Risk Committee monitor and review the IRRBB risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of\nthe management of IRRBB. The Barclays Bank UK Group Board Risk Committee reviews the interest rate risk profile, including setting of risk\nappetite at a minimum annually and the impact of stress scenarios on the interest rate risk of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s banking books.\nIn addition, the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s IRRBB policy sets out the processes and key controls required to identify all IRRBB risks arising\nfrom banking book operations, to monitor the risk exposures via a set of metrics with a frequency in line with the risk management horizon,\nand to manage these risks within agreed risk appetite and limits.", "page_start": 66, "page_end": 67, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

In each sector there are a range of vulnerabilities;\nwhilst Barclays distinguishes elevated activities within high-level sectors, not all our clients in sectors classified as elevated will have high\ncarbon intensity or physical risk vulnerability.\nFor Barclays Bank UK PLC, UK Mortgages and Business Banking Agriculture have been identified as portfolios with \u2018elevated\u2019 exposure to\nthe physical and transition risks of climate change. Barclays Bank UK Group has exposure to other elevated sectors in the Business Bank\nportfolio which are of lower materiality. Climate risk considerations have been incorporated into annual mandate and scale reviews across\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s portfolios.\nThe UK Mortgages portfolio is affected by physical risks, including flooding, subsidence and coastal erosion. From a transition risk\nperspective, the UK Mortgages portfolio is exposed to potential changes in energy efficiency performance requirements. Both the physical\nand transition risks that the UK Mortgages portfolio is exposed to may impact property valuations and affordability.\nThe Business Banking Agriculture portfolio is exposed to the physical risks of climate change such as flooding and drought. The Dairy &\nCattle sub-sector is exposed to the transition risks of climate change, including changes in consumer behaviour, as well as the potential\nintroduction of emissions taxation given the sector\u2019s significant contribution to the UK\u2019s methane emissions.\nSubsidence: Total Volume of stock (as % of total UK Mortgages portfolio) per risk band\nSubsidence is driven by the interplay of precipitation, temperature and soil type factors, which result in volumetric changes to the soil.\nIncreased volatility in weather conditions, as a result of climate change, contributes to the acceleration of subsidence impacts. Some areas,\nparticularly those with high concentrations of clay soil for example, London, are more susceptible to subsidence. This shrink-swell impact\ncan cause localised property level impacts, resulting in impacts to the valuation of a property, or impacts to affordability through\nremediation costs and high insurance premiums.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group works with a third-party climate data provider to support climate risk data enhancements within the UK\nMortgages portfolio. This includes the ability to map the subsidence risk at a property level. The subsidence risk scoring is based on soil\nproperties, in particular the extent to which the soil will shrink under hot and dry weather conditions, as well as the predicted temperature\nand probability of extreme rainfall. These variables are combined with subsidence claims per postcode to generate a pseudo-quantitative\nscore, where a property in class 9 is around nine times more likely as a property in class 1 to make a subsidence claim. A small proportion\nof the UK Mortgages portfolio is not mapped to a subsidence risk score (c.5.6%). This is due either to a lack of data coverage (i.e. the\nproperty is not covered by underlying maps), or a lack of certainty in address matching.\nAs at As at\n30 September 30 September\n20241 2023\nRisk Band Qualitative Risk Score Volume % Volume %\n0 No Subsidence Risk \u2014 \u2014\n1 9.6 9.5\n2 Low 36.1 36.0\n3 23.4 23.5\n4 4.7 4.7\n5 Moderate 4.6 4.7\n6 3.3 3.4\n7 2.4 2.4\n8 High \u2014 \u2014\n9 0.2 0.3\n10 5.3 5.4\n11 \u2014 \u2014\n12 2.6 2.6\nVery High\n13 \u2014 \u2014\n14 \u2014 \u2014\n15 2.2 2.3\nMissing 5.6 5.2\nNote\n1 Data collected from 3rd party source based on one quarter lag, 30 September 2024 closest available dataset.\nFlood: Total Volume of stock (as % of total UK Mortgages portfolio) per risk band\nFlooding in the UK is forecast to increase over time, with the potential for this increase to accelerate if greenhouse gas emissions are not\nreduced.

This has enabled the Barclays Bank UK Group to move from postcode level to property level flood data granularity.\nFlood Risk bands are based on average annual loss, generated using flood hazard frequency and flood depth from tidal, surface, pluvial and\nfluvial flooding and accounting for the mitigating impact of flood defences where these are present. Properties in the Moderate and High\nRisk bands are expected to face above average insurance costs given their elevated exposure to flood risk. Those within the Very High band\nand which meet certain requirements (e.g. owner occupied, built before-2009, are a single residential unit or a building comprising of two\nor three residential units) are considered likely to be eligible for Flood Re (a government subsidised flood insurance scheme).\nAs at As at\n30 September 30 September\n20241 2023\nRisk Band Volume % Volume %\nNegligible 80.9 81.3\nVery Low 7.6 7.6\nLow 1.8 1.8\nModerate 1.6 1.6\nHigh 2.6 2.6\nVery High 1.2 1.2\nMissing 4.3 3.9\nNote\n1 Data collected from 3rd party source based on one quarter lag, 30 September 2024 closest available dataset.\nFlood: Very High & High Flood Risk Exposure per region (as % of Total Regional Exposure)\nThe map below represents the proportion of properties within the UK Mortgages portfolio at High and Very High risk of flood per region as\na percentage of the total regional exposure (excluding Kensington Mortgage Company originated properties).

The increased volatility of weather\nconditions, as a result of climate change contribute to the acceleration of coastal erosion impacts.\nCoastal erosion risk is calculated using the modelled hazard level and the likelihood of that particular hazard impacting the value of the\nproperty. For example, a score of 100 (Very High Risk) might be assigned to a property within an area of predicted coastline retreat. In this\nsituation, the likelihood of the ground collapsing is high (the coastal erosion data has determined that the current surface will no longer\nexist in n years) and the potential severity of damage to the property is also high (the building itself could partially or completely collapse\ninto the sea).\nAs at 30 As at 30\nSeptember September\n20241 2023\nRisk Band Volume % Volume %\nNegligible 94.4 94.8\nLow 0.0 0.0\nModerate 0.0 0.0\nVery High 0.0 0.0\nMissing 5.6 5.2\nNote\n1 Data collected from 3rd party source based on one quarter lag, 30 September 2024 closest available dataset.\nCurrent and Potential Energy Performance Certificate (EPC): Total Volume of stock (as % of total UK Mortgages portfolio) per EPC\nrating\nThe transition risk in the UK Mortgages portfolio is assessed via the distribution of Current & Potential EPC ratings across the portfolio. One\nof the levers to decarbonise the UK housing stock for the UK Government is to tighten energy efficiency requirements. In 2024, the UK\nGovernment announced that the minimum EPC rating of rental properties will be raised to EPC C (from EPC E) by 2030. It is anticipated that\nany tightening of minimum energy efficiency standards (MEES) will focus initially on buy-to-let properties. Buy-to-Let properties which are\nprivately rented are currently required to have a minimum EPC rating of E. The transition risk identified has the potential to impact the\nvaluation of properties directly, alongside impacting affordability as properties which fall under MEES may no longer be able to be rented\nout or the landlord may need to pay for retrofitting to be brought up to standard.\nEPC ratings range from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). Current and Potential EPC ratings are used as the basis for assessing\nexpected energy costs but do not give a precise picture of emission intensity. The UK Mortgages portfolio is mapped to the Government\nEPC Register. Properties may not feature on the Government EPC Register as some properties may have never been required to have an\nEPC rating (not been sold or rented out since 2007), their EPC rating may have expired (EPC ratings are valid for 10 years) or the property\nmay be in Scotland or Northern Ireland (which use separate databases). Whilst Barclays\u2019 proportion of \u2018missing EPC ratings\u2019 has declined\nyear on year, the issue of missing EPC ratings is prevalent across the industry.\nCurrent EPC: Residential and Buy-to-let balances and volume of stock per EPC rating as at September 20241\nCurrent EPC Rating Residential Balance as % of Volume as % of Buy-to-Let Balance as % of Volume as % of\nMortgage Balances Residential Residential Mortgage Balances Buy-to-Let Buy-to-Let\nMortgages portfolio Mortgages portfolio Mortgages portfolio Mortgages portfolio\n\u00a3m % % \u00a3m % %\nA 601 0.4 0.3 19 0.1 0.1\nB 23,205 16.5 15.2 1,940 11.0 9.1\nC 26,952 19.1 18.4 5,456 30.9 31.8\nD 42,000 29.8 27.4 5,986 33.9 34.2\nE 16,695 11.9 9.9 1,587 9.0 9.2\nF 3,817 2.7 2.1 98 0.6 0.6\nG 723 0.5 0.4 25 0.1 0.1\nMissing 26,769 19.1 26.3 2,529 14.4 14.9\nTotal 140,762 100 100 17,640 100 100\nNote\n1 Data matching provided by 3rd party source based on one quarter lag, 30 September 2024 closest available dataset - EPC monitoring based on 30\nSeptember 2024 portfolio and 30 September 2024 Government EPC Register.

Gross loans and advances at\namortised cost as at 31 December 2024 includes \u00a38.3bn of unsecured lending balances from the acquisition of Tesco Bank, comprising of\n\u00a34.2bn of credit card receivables and \u00a34.1bn of unsecured personal loans, with corresponding impairment allowance of \u00a30.2bn. On the\nacquisition date, balances were originated into Stage 1 with \u00a30.06bn in purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) balances. POCI\nbalances represent a fixed pool of assets purchased at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of\norigination to date of acquisition.\nSummary of performance in the year\nGross exposure: Gross loans and advances at amortised cost to customers and banks have increased to \u00a3226bn (2023: \u00a3221bn), driven by\nthe \u00a38.3bn acquisition of Tesco Bank, partially offset by \u00a3(2.1)bn continued repayment of government scheme lending in Business Banking\nand \u00a3(0.8)bn securitisation of mortgage balances in Q424.\nMaximum exposure: The Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s net exposure to credit risk has increased to \u00a3171bn (2023: \u00a3143bn). This is primarily\ndriven by the acquisition of Tesco Bank (leading to an increase of \u00a313.2bn in loan commitments and \u00a38.3bn in loans and advances at\namortised cost), \u00a37bn increase in government issued debt securities, partially offset by a \u00a3(5)bn reduction in cash and balances at central\nbanks. Overall mitigation held against the total exposure has decreased to 53% (2023: 58%), primarily due to increase in unsecured\nportfolio driven by the Tesco Bank acquisition and an increase in government issued debt securities considered low risk.\nCredit quality: Delinquencies remain broadly stable. UK Cards provisioning continues to be underpinned by low delinquencies and strong\ncredit quality. A range of activities are in place to protect our existing defensive positioning against macroeconomic headwinds. Further\nanalysis on the credit quality of assets is presented in the approach to management and representation of credit quality section.\nStage decomposition: A net decrease of \u00a31.1bn is observed in Stage 2 gross exposure driven by an improved GDP forecast and\nrepayments in Business Banking. Stage 3 balances remains broadly stable at \u00a33.5bn (2023: \u00a33.4bn). Refer to page 99 for further details.\nScenario: The economy is gradually recovering and is further stimulated as restrictive monetary policy continues loosening. For Q424,\nmacroeconomic scenarios have been refreshed and are designed around a broad range of economic outcomes. The Downside 2 (DS2)\nscenario has been broadly aligned to Barclays 2024 Internal Stress Test (IST24) which includes climate drivers. Refer to the Barclays\nresilience to climate scenarios on page 62 for further details.\nECL: Impairment allowances on loans and advances at amortised cost including off-balance sheet remains broadly stable at \u00a31,626m\n(2023: \u00a31,686m) underpinned by an improved macroeconomic outlook and the acquisition of Tesco Bank. On-balance sheet coverage\nremains strong and stable at 0.8% (2023: 0.8%).\nCharge: Credit impairment charges were \u00a3352m (2023: \u00a3308m), driven by the charge on the acquisition of Tesco Bank partially offset by a\nresilient credit performance in UK cards and UK Mortgages.\nManagement adjustments: Economic uncertainty adjustments have decreased to \u00a378m (2023: \u00a3181m), informed by lower inflationary risk\nand a resilient credit performance in UK retail lending. Refer to the Management adjustment to models for impairment section on page 100\nfor further details.\nClimate: Barclays has performed a credit risk assessment of physical and transition risk due to climate change through a combination of a\nscenario approach and targeted reviews on specific portfolios identified as more susceptible to climate risk. As further enhancements\nduring the year, the DS2 scenario has been aligned to the IST24 which is climate aware and for specific portfolios new climate modelling\ntechniques were utilised to assess physical and transition risk due to climate change at customer level.\nFurther detail can be found in the Financial statements section in Note 8 Credit impairment charges.

These\nadjustments result from data limitations and model performance related issues identified through model monitoring and other established\ngovernance processes.\nOther adjustments of \u00a3164m (2023: \u00a3211m) includes:\nAdjustments for definition of default (DOD) under the Capital Requirements Regulation and model monitoring across products.\nRetail mortgages \u00a368m (2023: \u00a3121m): The reduction is driven by the adoption of a new LGD2 (Loss Given Default) model for the default\nbook and re-sizing of model monitoring adjustments.\nRetail credit cards \u00a3(22)m (2023: \u00a3(9)m): The movement is driven by a model monitoring adjustment to correct for 12m PD over\nprediction.\nRetail other \u00a375m (2023: \u00a364m): The increase reflects a re-sizing of adjustments for model monitoring.\nCorporate loans \u00a343m (2023: \u00a335m): Adjustments remain broadly stable compared to the previous year.\nRisk review\nRisk performance\nCredit risk\nClimate risk ECL assessment\nBarclays Bank UK Group performed a credit risk assessment of physical and transition risk due to climate change. This was delivered\nthrough a combination of a scenario approach and targeted reviews on specific portfolios identified as more susceptible to climate risk.\nScenario Approach: The IFRS 9 Downside 2 scenario has been updated and aligned to the 2024 Internal Stress Test scenario which is\nclimate aware, ensuring that climate is being considered within the modelled ECL output via existing macroeconomic variables.\nSpecific Approach: The approach reviewed portfolios previously identified from both internal and external stress tests as more susceptible\nto climate risks. In particular, new climate modelling techniques were utilised to inform customer level PD and LGD spreads of physical and\ntransition risk due to climate change for the UK Mortgages portfolio (both PD and LGD). The output of this review did not provide variances\nin ECL deemed sufficiently certain to warrant raising an additional climate-related charge in 2024.\nBarclays Bank UK Group acknowledges that impairment could increase over time as risks become more tangible and impact consumers\nand clients through physical risks or via impacts from the transition to a low carbon economy. Therefore, Barclays Bank UK Group\ncontinues to review credit risk outputs to determine if any additional physical or transition climate risks are identified that are not\nsufficiently captured via model output.\nMeasurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis\nThe measurement of modelled ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of probabilities of default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD), a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives, estimation of exposures at default (EAD) and\nassessing significant increases in credit risk. The Barclays Bank UK Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external\nconsensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury (short and medium term forecasts) and Bloomberg (based on\nmedian of economic forecasts), which forms the Baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and\ntwo favourable scenarios (Upside 1 and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated\nto a broadly similar severity to the internal stress tests and stress scenarios provided by regulators whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific\nsensitivities and non-linearity. The favourable scenarios are designed to reflect plausible upside risks to the Baseline scenario which are\nbroadly consistent with the economic narrative approved by the Senior Scenario Review Committee. All scenarios are regenerated at a\nminimum semi-annually. The scenarios include key economic variables, (including GDP, unemployment, House Price Index (HPI) and base\nrate), and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations. The upside and downside shocks are designed to\nevolve over a five-year stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging to a steady state after approximately seven years. The same\nscenarios used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used to inform the Barclays Bank UK Group's internal planning.\nScenarios used to calculate the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s ECL charge were refreshed in Q424 with the Baseline scenario reflecting the latest\nconsensus macroeconomic forecasts available at the time of the scenario refresh. In the Baseline scenario, following an encouraging first\nhalf of 2024, UK economic growth slowed in H224. However, it is further stimulated as restrictive monetary policy continues to loosen. GDP\ngrowth in 2025 is expected to be 1.4%. Labour markets in major economies remain broadly resilient with unemployment rates relatively\nclose to historic lows and are only expected to increase moderately. The UK unemployment rate peaks at 4.5% in 2026 before returning to\n4.4% for the reminder of the 5-year projection period. The Bank of England cuts rates three times by 25bp in 2025. As lower rates feed into\nnew mortgages, UK house prices stabilise and resume the upward trend from 2025.\nThe Downside 2 scenario has been broadly aligned to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s 2024 internal stress test which includes climate drivers.\nUnder this scenario, long-standing structural issues, restrictive monetary policy and persistent household affordability loss leads to a sharp\ndemand-driven economic contraction that precipitates into a severe global recession and disinflation process. The economic slowdown\nleads to rising unemployment rates as lay-offs intensify. UK unemployment peaks at 8.4% during 2026. The combination of high interest\nrates and subdued growth leads to inflation declines which in turn causes the Bank of England to reduce rates. In the Upside 2 scenario, a\nrise in labour force participation and higher productivity contribute to accelerated economic growth, without creating new inflationary\npressures. The Bank of England lowers interest rates stimulating private consumption and investment growth. Demand for labour\nincreases. and the unemployment rate stabilises and starts falling again. As geopolitical tensions ease, low inflation supports consumer\npurchasing power and contributes further to a healthy GDP growth. The strong economic outlook and lower interest rates provide a boost\nto house prices growth and support bullish financial markets.\nThe methodology for estimating scenario probability weights involves simulating a range of future paths for UK GDP using historical data\nwith five scenarios mapped against the distribution of these future paths. The median is centred around the Baseline with scenarios further\nfrom the Baseline attracting a lower weighting before the five weights are normalised to equate to 100%. The decrease in Downside and\nincrease in Upside scenario weights is driven by the improvement in GDP actuals and near-term outlook, bringing the Baseline scenario\ncloser to the Upside and further away from the Downside scenarios. For further details see page 104.\nThe economic uncertainty adjustments of \u00a378m (2023: \u00a3181m) have been applied as overlays to the modelled ECL output. Previously held\nuncertainty adjustments reflecting affordability concerns were reduced during the year, informed by lower inflationary risk and a resilient\ncredit performance in retail lending.

The Barclays Bank UK Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate\nthe risk.\nThe table below presents an industry credit risk concentration analysis of loans and advances at amortised cost net of impairment\nallowance including breakdown by geographical location of the counterparty or customers. Further includes debt securities at amortised\ncost, off-balance sheet commitments and financial guarantees and contingent liabilities at amortised cost by geography.\nFurther detail on Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s policies with regard to managing concentration risk is presented in the Barclays Bank UK PLC\nPillar 3 report (unaudited).\nCredit risk concentration by industry and geography (audited)\nLoans and advances at amortised cost net of impairment allowance\nGeography\nIndustry\nUnited Kingdom Americas Europe Others Total\nBarclays Bank UK Group\nAs at 31 December 2024 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nAgriculture, Food and Forest Products 3,318 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3,318\nMining and Quarrying 8 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 8\nManufacturing 410 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 410\nGovernment and central bank 3,153 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3,153\nBanks 260 1 21 \u2014 282\nEnergy and water 42 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 42\nMaterials and Building 7,247 \u2014 \u2014 1 7,248\nWholesale and retail distribution and leisure 2,003 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2,003\nTransport and storage 243 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 243\nHome Loans 163,105 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 163,105\nBusiness and other services 3,283 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3,283\nOther Financial Institutions 260 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 260\nCards, unsecured loans and other personal lending 23,353 5 1 2 23,361\nTotal loans and advances at amortised cost 206,685 6 22 3 206,716\nDebt securities at amortised cost 10,118 1,657 434 5,774 17,983\nTotal loans and advances at amortised cost including\ndebt securities1 216,803 1,663 456 5,777 224,699\nContingent liabilities 710 0 0 0 710\nLoan commitments 66,946 7 5 1 66,959\nTotal off-balance sheet 67,656 7 5 1 67,669\nAs at 31 December 2023 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nAgriculture, Food and Forest Products 3,518 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 3,518\nMining and Quarrying 6 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6\nManufacturing 507 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 507\nGovernment and central bank 4,722 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 4,722\nBanks 174 61 56 \u2014 291\nEnergy and water 58 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 58\nMaterials and Building 8,520 3 2 5 8,530\nWholesale and retail distribution and leisure 2,489 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 2,489\nTransport and storage 345 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 345\nHome Loans 163,510 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 163,510\nBusiness and other services 3,766 4 \u2014 \u2014 3,770\nOther Financial Institutions 247 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 247\nCards, unsecured loans and other personal lending 13,997 2 3 \u2014 14,002\nTotal loans and advances at amortised cost 201,859 70 61 5 201,995\nDebt securities at amortised cost 8,584 1,771 282 7,157 17,794\nTotal loans and advances at amortised cost including\n210,443 1,841 343 7,162 219,789\ndebt securities\nContingent liabilities 661 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 661\nLoan commitments 49,800 10 6 4 49,820\nTotal off-balance sheet 50,461 10 6 4 50,481\nNotes\n1 Loans and advances for 2024 include POCI assets of \u00a357m\n2 Refer to Carbon related assets table on page 76 for more details on the \"Exposures towards sectors that highly contribute to carbon related assets\" under the\nrespective Industry sectors.", "page_start": 109, "page_end": 112, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

derive the probability of default of clients at inception and on an ongoing basis.\nFor loans that are not past due, these descriptions can be summarised as follows:\nStrong: there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full.\nSatisfactory: while there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore of no cause for concern to the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup, the asset may not be collateralised, or may relate to unsecured retail facilities. At the lower end of this grade there are customers\nthat are being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, mortgages\nwith a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.\nHigher Risk: there is concern over the obligor\u2019s ability to make payments when due. However, these have not yet converted to actual\ndelinquency. There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided. However, the borrower or counterparty is\ncontinuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.\nLoans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s impairment policies. These loans are all considered higher risk for the purpose of this analysis of credit quality.\nDebt securities\nFor assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer. Most\nlisted and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies. The Barclays Bank UK Group mainly uses external credit ratings\nprovided by Standard & Poor\u2019s, Fitch or Moody\u2019s.

The liquidity risk framework is used to manage all liquidity risk exposures under both Business-As-Usual\nand stressed conditions. The framework is designed to maintain liquidity resources that are sufficient in amount, quality and funding tenor\nprofile to support the liquidity risk appetite as expressed by the Barclays Bank UK PLC Board. The liquidity risk appetite is monitored against\nboth internal and regulatory liquidity metrics.\nLiquidity regulation\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group monitors its position against both the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio)\naccording to the PRA regulatory requirements which include certain Basel III standards that were retained in the UK regulatory framework\nfrom 1 January 2022 as part of the UK's withdrawal from the EU.\nThe LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a bank\u2019s liquidity risk profile by holding sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets\n(HQLA) to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The LCR requirement takes into account the relative stability of different\nsources of funding and potential incremental funding requirements in a stress. The NSFR has been developed to promote a sustainable and\nstable structure of assets and liabilities.\nLiquidity risk stress testing\nThe Internal Liquidity Stress Test (ILST) measures the potential contractual and contingent stress outflows under a range of stress\nscenarios, which are then used to determine the size of the Liquidity Pool that is needed to meet anticipated outflows if a stress were to\noccur. The scenarios include a 30 day Barclays-specific stress event, a 90 day market-wide stress event and a 30 day combined scenario\nconsisting of both a Barclays-specific and market-wide stress event. Barclays Bank UK Group also runs a liquidity stress test which\nmeasures the anticipated outflows over a 12 month market-wide scenario.\nAs at 31 December 2024, Barclays Bank UK Group held eligible liquidity assets in excess of 100% of the net stress outflows as measured\naccording to its internal and external regulatory requirements. This includes the stress outflows derived from the acquisition of Tesco\nBank\u2019s retail banking business on 1 November 2024. A significant portion of the Liquidity Pool was held in cash and deposits with the Bank\nof England.\nThe Liquidity Pool increased to \u00a367bn (December 2023: \u00a365bn) and the LCR to 202% (December 2023: 180%) driven by an increase in\ncustomer deposits.\nAs at 31.12.24 As at 31.12.23\n\u00a3bn \u00a3bn\nBarclays Bank UK Group liquidity pool 67 65\n% %\nBarclays Bank UK Group liquidity coverage ratio1 202 180\nNote\n1 Represents the average of the last 12 spot month end ratios.\nBarclays Bank UK Group maintains access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including those available from\nterm investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, short-term funding markets and repo markets. Key sources of\nwholesale funding include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, covered bonds and other securitisations. This funding\ncapacity enables Barclays Bank UK Group to maintain a stable and diversified funding base.\nBarclays Bank UK Group also supports various central bank monetary initiatives, such as the Bank of England\u2019s Term Funding Scheme with\nadditional incentives for SMEs (TFSME). These are reported under \u2018repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing\u2019 on the\nbalance sheet. Barclays Bank UK Group had \u00a315bn TFSME balances outstanding at the year-end.\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\nThe NSFR metric requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile taking into account both on and certain off-balance sheet exposures\nover a medium to long-term period. The ratio is defined as the Available Stable Funding (capital and certain liabilities which are treated as\nstable sources of funding) relative to the Required Stable Funding (a measure of assets on the balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet\nexposures which may require long term funding). The NSFR (average of the last four spot quarter end positions) was 159% at December\n2024, equivalent to a surplus of \u00a395bn above the regulatory requirement and demonstrates Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s stable funding\nbalance sheet profile.", "page_start": 135, "page_end": 137, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

The potential volatility of Net Interest Income (NII) is\nmeasured by an Annual Earnings at Risk (AEaR) metric which is monitored regularly and reported to senior management and the Barclays\nBank UK PLC Board Risk Committee as part of the limit monitoring framework.\nSummary of performance in the period\nNII sensitivity to a -25bp shock has decreased due to changes in balance sheet composition of the banking book during the year.

The Operational Risk Framework is therefore focused on identifying operational risks, assessing them and\nmanaging them within the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s approved risk appetite.\nThe operational risk principal risk comprises the following risks: Change Delivery Management Risk, Data Management Risk; Financial\nReporting Risk; Fraud Risk; Information Security Risk; Operational Recovery Planning Risk; Payments Process Risk; People Risk; Physical\nSecurity Risk; Premises Risk; Risk Reporting; Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology Risk and Transaction Operations Risk. The operational risk\nprofile is also informed by a number of connected risks: Cybersecurity, Data, and Resilience. These themes represent threats to the Barclays\nBank UK Group that extend across multiple risk types, and therefore require an integrated risk management approach.\nFor definitions of these risks refer to pages 140 to 141 of the Barclays Bank UK PLC Pillar 3 Report 2024. To provide complete coverage of\nthe potential adverse impacts on the Barclays Bank UK Group arising from operational risk, the operational risk taxonomy extends beyond\nthe risks listed above to cover operational risks associated with other principal risks too.\nThis section provides an analysis of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s operational risk profile, including events above the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s reportable threshold, which have had a financial impact in 2024. The Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s operational risk profile is informed\nby bottom-up risk assessments undertaken by each business unit and top-down qualitative review for each risk type. Fraud, Transaction\nOperations, Information Security and Technology continue to be highlighted as key operational risk exposures.\nFor information on compliance risk events, see the compliance risk section.\nSummary of performance in the period\nDuring 2024, total operational risk losses1 fell to \u00a374m (2023: \u00a384m) while the number of recorded events for 2024 decreased to 1,446\n(2023: 2,054). The total operational risk losses for the year were mainly driven by events falling within the Execution, Delivery & Process\nManagement and External Fraud categories, which tend to be high volume but low impact events.\nNote\n1 The data disclosed includes operational risk losses for reportable events impacting the Barclays Bank UK Group business areas, having impact of > \u00a310,000\nand excludes events that are compliance or legal risk, aggregate and boundary events.

Losses decreased to \u00a340m accounting for 54% of total losses (2023: \u00a369m / 82%). In this\ncategory, high volume, low value events are driven by transactional fraud often related to debit and credit card usage.

Specific areas of focus include\nnew and enhanced fraud prevention systems and tools to combat the increasing level of fraud attempts being made whilst minimising\ndisruption to genuine transactions. Fraud remains an industry wide threat and the Barclays Bank UK Group continues to work closely with\nexternal partners on various prevention initiatives.\nFraudsters use various techniques to target customers and colleagues directly (i.e., Third Party Fraud), or the Barclays Bank UK Group\ndirectly (i.e., First Party Fraud). In the UK and Europe, Authorised Push Payment (APP) Scams is a growing fraud type where customers are\ndeceived to transfer funds from their account to a bad actor. Fraud can also be committed by one or more employees and workers of any\nentity (i.e., Internal Fraud) or any unauthorised trading fraud. Additionally, the Barclays Bank UK Group continues to invest in its processing\ninfrastructure to manage the risk of processing errors as well as ensuring scalability of operations.\nOperational Resilience remains a key area of focus for the Barclays Bank UK Group, having been reinforced in recent years due to potential\noperational disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Barclays Bank UK Group continues to strengthen its resilience approach across\nits most important business services to improve recoverability and assurance thereof by reviewing scenarios based on current global\nclimates.\nOperational risk associated with cybersecurity remains a top focus for the Barclays Bank UK Group. The sophistication of threat actors\ncontinues to grow as noted by multiple external risk events observed throughout the year.

Legal risk tolerances and legal risk appetite have also been reviewed.\nTolerances adherence is assessed through key indicators, which are also used to evaluate the legal risk profile and are reviewed, at least\nannually, through the relevant risk and control committees. Mandatory controls to manage legal risks are set out in the legal risk standards\nand are subject to ongoing monitoring.\nRisk review\nSupervision and regulation\nSupervision of the Barclays Bank UK Group\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s operations are subject to a large number of rules and regulations applicable to the conduct of banking and\nother financial services business. These apply to business operations, impact financial returns and include capital, leverage and liquidity\nrequirements, authorisation, registration and reporting requirements, restrictions on certain activities, and conduct of business regulations,\namongst other applicable regulatory requirements.\nThe day-to-day regulation and supervision of the Barclays Bank UK Group is divided between the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) (a\ndivision of the Bank of England (BoE)) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In addition, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) of the\nBoE has influence on the prudential requirements that may be imposed on the banking system through its powers of direction and\nrecommendation. Certain members of the Barclays Bank UK Group are also subject to regulatory initiatives undertaken by the UK Payment\nSystems Regulator (PSR), as a participant in payment systems regulated by the PSR.\nBarclays Bank UK PLC is an authorised person, with permission to accept deposits, amongst other things, and is subject to prudential\nregulation and supervision by the PRA and to conduct regulation and supervision by the FCA. The Barclays Bank UK Group is subject to\nprudential supervision on a group sub-consolidated basis and Barclays Bank UK PLC is subject to prudential supervision on an individual\nbasis. The Barclays Group as a whole is subject to prudential supervision by the PRA on a group consolidated basis. Barclays PLC has been\napproved by the PRA as a financial holding company. Barclays Global Service Centre Private Limited and Barclays Execution Services\nLimited are appointed representatives of Barclays Bank UK PLC and Tesco Stores Limited is an introducer appointed representative of\nBarclays Bank UK PLC. These are arrangements under which the appointed representative is permitted to carry on certain regulated\nactivities in the UK which its principal takes responsibility for and oversees. Appointed representative arrangements must comply with\ncertain statutory and FCA rules, including on prescribed contractual terms and ongoing monitoring and supervision of the appointed\nrepresentative by the principal.\nThe PRA\u2019s supervision of the Barclays Bank UK Group is conducted through a variety of regulatory tools, including the collection of\ninformation by way of prudential returns or cross-firm reviews, reports obtained from skilled persons, information gathering, regular\nsupervisory visits to firms and regular continuous assessment meetings with the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s management and relevant\nstakeholders to discuss matters such as strategy, governance, financial resilience, operational resilience, risk management, and recovery\nand resolution.\nFurther, the BoE, as the UK resolution authority, informs prudential requirements and sets requirements for the Group relating to resolution\npreparedness.\nThe FCA\u2019s supervision of the Barclays Bank UK Group is carried out through a combination of proactive engagement meetings, regular\nsupervisory visits, information gathering and regular meetings with Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s management and relevant stakeholders to\ndiscuss matters such as customer strategy, fair treatment of customers, and financial crime controls, as well as cross-sectoral reviews\nwhich analyse the different areas of the market and the risks that may lie ahead.\nThe FCA and the PRA also apply the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (the SMCR) which imposes a regulatory approval, individual\naccountability and fitness and propriety framework in respect of senior individuals within relevant firms.\nFCA supervision has focused on strategic transformation, financial crime controls, conduct risk and customer/client outcomes under the\nConsumer Duty (which now applies to both open and closed products), firm culture and non-financial misconduct, fraud controls and\nreimbursement, access to cash, the fair treatment of vulnerable customers and payment account access and closures.\nPRA supervision has focused on strategic transformation, financial and operational resilience (including cyber risk), governance, credit risk\nmanagement, model risk management, data risk management, systems and controls, climate risk and resolvability, where resolvability is\nreviewed in conjunction with the Resolution Directorate (a division of the BoE).\nBoth the PRA and the FCA apply standards that generally either anticipate or go beyond requirements established by global or EU\nstandards, whether in relation to capital, leverage and liquidity, resolvability and resolution or matters of conduct. The UK is in the process\nof reviewing, repealing and, where relevant, replacing the EU legislation that was onshored into English law following the UK's departure\nfrom the EU (assimilated law). The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (FSMA 2023) established a framework for the revocation of\nassimilated law relating to financial services, with HM Treasury now repealing certain requirements set out in assimilated law. However, the\nGovernment is not expected to revoke assimilated law relating to financial services unless the FCA and/or PRA have drafted and consulted\non rules in the relevant areas, where it is appropriate that the provisions are replaced. HM Treasury may specify parts of assimilated law\nwhere the regulators are exempt from requirements to consult on new replacement rules, for example where they are restating assimilated\nlaw revoked through FSMA 2023 in their rulebooks without material changes or where they are replacing revoked assimilated law with\nmaterial changes but the only material effect is to reduce a regulatory burden. Where changes also have other material effects, which may\ninclude impacts on the regulators\u2019 objectives, for example, the Government has indicated that it is appropriate to require the regulators to\nconsult. There is a significant volume of assimilated law for the UK Government to repeal and replace, so this process remains ongoing and\nthe regulatory landscape continues to develop. There is potential for an increase in regulatory implementation costs in the near term to\nadapt systems and controls, although areas of divergence from assimilated law have been limited to date.\nFSMA 2023 also introduced the framework for the \u2018designated activities regime\u2019 (DAR). The DAR framework allows HM Treasury to\ndesignate certain activities which do not require regulatory authorisation to carry them out, but which are currently subject to FCA and PRA\nsupervision under assimilated law.

The DAR will apply to\nboth authorised and unauthorised persons carrying on designated activities. Implementation costs may be incurred to adapt existing\nprocesses as the DAR develops. In January 2025, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Designated Activities) (Supervision and\nRisk review\nSupervision and regulation\nEnforcement) Regulations 2025 came into effect. These Regulations give the FCA supervisory and enforcement powers in respect of short\nselling and consumer composite investment activities.\nPrudential regulation\nCertain Basel III standards were originally implemented in EU and UK law through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the\nCapital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV), as amended by CRR II and CRD V. These standards were retained in the UK regulatory\nframework via a series of onshoring instruments when the UK withdrew from the European Union. Under the assimilated law version of the\nCRR (the UK CRR), the Barclays Group is subject to a binding Pillar 1 minimum capital requirement to satisfy a Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). However, in practice the Barclays Group is required to and does hold capital\nsignificantly in excess of this requirement. Additional capital requirements apply to the Barclays Group including Pillar 2A minimum\nrequirements and capital buffers, including the capital conservation buffer, the countercyclical capital buffer, the O-SII buffer and the G-SIB\nbuffer, as well as PRA buffer requirements (the Pillar 2B), as explained further below.\nGlobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs), such as the Barclays Group, are subject to a number of additional prudential requirements,\nincluding the requirement to hold additional loss-absorbing capacity and additional capital buffers above the level required by Basel III\nstandards. The level of the G-SIB buffer is set by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) according to a bank\u2019s systemic importance and can\nrange from 1% to 3.5% of RWAs. The G-SIB buffer must be met with CET1 capital. In November 2024, the FSB published an update to its\nlist of G-SIBs, maintaining the 1.5% G-SIB buffer that applies to the Barclays Group.\nThe Barclays Group is subject to a \u2018combined buffer requirement\u2019 which includes (i) a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWAs, and (ii)\na countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). The CCyB is based on rates determined by the regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which\nthe Barclays Group maintains exposures. In the UK, the CCyB rate is set by the FPC and is currently 2%. Like the capital conservation buffer,\nthe CCyB must be met entirely with CET1 capital.\nThe PRA requires UK firms to hold additional capital to cover risks which the PRA assesses are not fully captured by the Pillar 1 capital\nrequirement. The PRA sets this additional capital requirement (Pillar 2A) at least annually, derived from each firm's individual capital\nguidance. Under current PRA rules, the Pillar 2A requirement must be met with at least 56.25% CET1 capital, no more than 43.75%\nadditional Tier 1 (AT1) capital and no more than 25% tier 2 capital. In addition, the capital that firms use to meet their minimum\nrequirements (Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A) cannot be counted towards meeting the combined buffer requirement. In September 2024, the BoE\nand PRA issued a consultation paper (CP9/24) on changes to the Pillar 2A capital framework, including retiring the refined methodology\nfor calculating Pillar 2A requirements in light of incoming proposals to implement Basel III standards (discussed further below) and\nstreamlining firm-specific capital communications.\nThe PRA may also impose a confidential 'PRA buffer' to cover risks over a forward-looking planning horizon, including with regard to firm-\nspecific stresses or management and governance weaknesses. The PRA buffer must be met separately to the combined buffer\nrequirement, and must be met fully with CET1 capital.\nIn addition, Barclays Bank UK Group is subject to prudential regulation by the PRA and is required to meet a minimum Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) ratio of 12.9% comprising a 4.5% Pillar 1 requirement, a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, a 2% countercyclical buffer, a 1% O-SII\nbuffer and a 2.9% Pillar 2A add on.\nAs part of its approach to ring fencing, the FPC established a framework to apply a firm-specific systemic risk buffer (SRB) designed to\nincrease the capacity of ring-fenced bodies, such as Barclays Bank UK PLC, to absorb stress. The Other Systemically Important Institutions\nBuffer (O-SII buffer) has since replaced the SRB. The O-SII buffer can be set between 0% and 3% and has to be met solely with CET1\ncapital. The O-SII buffer rate applicable to Barclays Bank UK PLC is currently set by the PRA at 1% of RWAs. Previously, total assets were\nused as the metric to determine O-SII buffer rates but the FPC announced in 2022 that this would change to the UK leverage exposure\nmeasure and that it would recalibrate the thresholds used to determine O-SII buffer rates to prevent an overall tightening or loosening of\nthe framework relative to its pre-Covid level. The PRA\u2019s 2023 review of the O-SII buffer was based on end-2022 leverage exposure\nmeasures and maintained the O-SII buffer rate applicable to Barclays Bank UK PLC at 1% (applicable from January 2025). For future\nreviews, the average of firms\u2019 quarter-end leverage exposure measure over the year will be used to determine O-SII buffer rates, rather than\nthe year-end value.\nIn December 2023, the PRA published its first collection of near-final policy proposals for implementing certain remaining Basel III\nstandards (Basel 3.1), including revised frameworks for market risk, operational risk and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) risk. A second\npolicy statement was published by the PRA in September 2024, including near-final rules on credit risk and credit risk mitigation, the\nimplementation of an output floor (requiring reported RWAs calculated under standardised and modelled approaches to be a minimum of\n72.5% of fully standardised calculations), and disclosure and reporting. The implementation date for these standards has been extended to\n1 January 2027, with a transitional period to ensure full implementation by 1 January 2030.\nThe PRA is consulting on proposed amendments (CP14/24) to the large exposures (LE) framework to implement the remaining Basel large\nexposure standards (removing the option for firms to use internal models to calculate exposure values to securities financing transactions\nand introducing a mandatory substitution approach to calculate the effect of the use of credit risk mitigation techniques), as well as other\namendments including in respect of the LE limits to intragroup entities and removing the option for firms to exceed LE limits for trading\nbook exposures to third parties.\nAdditional minimum prudential requirements that apply to the Barclays Group to ensure that sufficient resources are maintained to provide\nloss absorption in a resolution context are discussed in the sub-section titled \u2018TLAC and MREL\u2019 below.", "page_start": 153, "page_end": 154, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

These exercises are designed to assess the resilience of banks to adverse economic or\nfinancial developments and ensure that they have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for the risks associated\nwith their business profile. Assessment by regulators is on both a quantitative and qualitative basis, the latter focusing on such elements as\ndata provision and stress testing capability, including model risk management and internal management processes and controls.\nRecovery and Resolution\nStabilisation and resolution framework\nThe current UK framework for recovery and resolution was established by the Banking Act 2009, as amended.\nThe BoE, as the UK resolution authority, has the power to resolve a UK financial institution that is failing or likely to fail by exercising certain\nstabilisation tools, including (i) bail-in: the cancellation, transfer or dilution of a relevant entity\u2019s equity and write-down or conversion of the\nclaims of a relevant entity's unsecured creditors (including holders of capital instruments) and conversion of those claims into equity as\nnecessary to restore solvency; (ii) the transfer of all or part of a relevant entity\u2019s' business to a private sector purchaser; and (iii) the transfer\nof all or part of a relevant entity's business to a \u201cbridge bank\u201d controlled by the BoE. When exercising any of its stabilisation powers, the BoE\nmust generally provide that shareholders bear first losses, followed by creditors in accordance with the priority of their claims in insolvency.\nIn order to enable the exercise of its stabilisation powers, the BoE may impose a temporary stay on the rights of creditors to terminate,\naccelerate or close out contracts, or override events of default or termination rights that might otherwise be invoked as a result of a\nresolution action and modify contractual arrangements in certain circumstances (including a variation of the terms of any securities). HM\nTreasury may also amend the law for the purpose of enabling it to use its powers under this regime effectively, potentially with\nretrospective effect.\nIn addition and distinct from bail-in, the BoE has the power to permanently write-down, or convert into equity, tier 1 capital instruments,\ntier 2 capital instruments and internal eligible liabilities at the point of non-viability of an institution pursuant to broader resolution powers\nunder the Banking Act.\nThe BoE\u2019s preferred approach for the resolution of the Barclays Group is a bail-in strategy with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC. Under\nsuch a strategy, Barclays PLC\u2019s subsidiaries (including entities within the Barclays Bank UK Group) would remain operational while Barclays\nPLC\u2019s capital instruments and eligible liabilities would be written down or converted to equity in order to recapitalise the Barclays Group\nand allow for the continued provision of services and operations throughout the resolution. The order in which the bail-in tool is applied\nreflects the hierarchy of capital instruments under applicable UK legislation and rules, and otherwise respecting the hierarchy of claims in\nan ordinary insolvency. Accordingly, the more subordinated the claim, the more likely losses will be suffered by owners of the claim.\nThe PRA has made rules that require authorised firms to draw up recovery plans and resolution packs. Recovery plans are designed to\noutline credible actions that authorised firms could implement in the event of severe stress in order to restore their business to a stable and\nsustainable condition. The submission of resolution packs was suspended by the PRA in 2018 until further notice and replaced by annual\nresolution reporting. It continues to be suspended pending PRA assessment of areas of potential duplication between different reporting\nexpectations. The Barclays Group, however, is required to provide the PRA with a recovery plan biennially, although the Barclays Group\nmaintains and refreshes this on an annual basis.\nRemoval of potential impediments to an orderly resolution of a banking group or one or more of its subsidiaries is considered as part of the\nBoE\u2019s resolution planning for each firm, and the BoE can require firms to make significant changes in order to enhance their resolvability.\nUnder the BoE\u2019s Resolvability Assessment Framework (RAF), firms are required to have in place capabilities covering three resolvability\noutcomes: (i) adequate financial resources; (ii) being able to continue to do business through resolution and restructuring; and (iii) being\nable to communicate and co-ordinate within the firm and with authorities. Barclays Group\u2019s second self-assessment report on resolvability\nunder the RAF was submitted to the PRA/BoE in 2023 and the BoE\u2019s assessment on the report was published in August 2024. The BoE\u2019s\n2024 assessment was more detailed than in previous years. The BoE identified that there are no shortcomings, deficiencies or substantive\nimpediments in the Group\u2019s capabilities that could impede Barclays\u2019 ability to execute the preferred resolution strategy. The BoE did note\nthat there were three areas for further enhancement relating to the provision of timely valuations, in respect of operational continuity in\nresolution relating to the inclusion of resolution-resilient language in service contracts, and restructuring planning. The Barclays Group\ncontinues to develop its capabilities in these areas and is engaging with the BoE on these areas identified for enhancements. In future, the\nPRA/BoE could exercise its various powers to direct the Barclays Group to address any relevant issues. In January 2025, amendments to the\nPRA rules were introduced which now require firms to make submissions under the relevant resolution rules on a \u2018periodic\u2019 basis rather\nthan the previous fixed two-year cycles (PS1/25). The BoE and PRA will require firms to submit their next resolution reports in 2026, with a\npublic disclosure to be made in 2027.\nTLAC and MREL\nThe Barclays Group is under the supervision of the BoE, as the UK resolution authority, and is subject to a Minimum Requirement for Own\nFunds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL), which includes a component reflecting the FSB\u2019s standards on total loss absorbency capacity (TLAC).\nSince 1 January 2022, G-SIBs with resolution entities incorporated in the UK have been required to meet an MREL equivalent to the higher\nof: (i) two times the sum of their Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements; or (ii) the higher of two times their leverage ratio requirement or 6.75%\nof leverage exposures. The Barclays Group is also required to meet binding external MRELs in 2024 on the basis of a bail-in resolution", "page_start": 154, "page_end": 155, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Internal MREL for material subsidiaries is subject to a scalar in the 75-90% range of the external\nrequirement that would apply to the subsidiary if it were a resolution entity. The starting point for the scalar is 90% for ring-fenced bank\nsub-groups. In October 2024, the BoE launched a consultation on proposals to amend its statement of policy on its approach to setting\nMREL (the MREL SoP). This forms part of the repeal and restatement (with modifications) process of assimilated law and the BoE does not\nconsider that its proposals would result in fundamental changes to the overall impact of its MREL policy.\nBank Levy and FSCS\nThe BRRD established a requirement for EU Member States to set up a pre-funded resolution financing arrangement with funding equal to\n1% of covered deposits by 31 December 2024 to cover the costs of bank resolutions. The UK implemented this requirement by way of a tax\non the balance sheets of banks known as the \u2018Bank Levy\u2019, which remains in place.\nIn addition, the UK has a statutory compensation fund called the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which is funded by way\nof annual levies on most authorised financial services firms including Barclays Bank UK PLC.\nStructural reform\nIn the UK, the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 put in place a framework for ring-fencing certain operations of large banks.\nRing-fencing requires, among other things, the separation of the retail and SME deposit-taking activities of UK banks from wholesale and\ninvestment banking operations into a legally distinct, operationally separate and economically independent entity (i.e., a \u2018ring-fenced\nbank\u2019), which is not permitted to undertake a range of activities. Under FSMA, the PRA is required to review its ring-fencing rules every five\nyears following the rules coming into force, with the first report having been published in January 2024. The PRA intends to consult in due\ncourse on targeted reforms to its ring-fencing rules as a result of its review, although the overall conclusion was that most of those rules\nare performing satisfactorily. Separately, HM Treasury has introduced legislative amendments to implement near-term reforms to the ring-\nfencing regime which took effect in February 2025. These reforms have, amongst other measures, increased the core deposit threshold\n(which determines whether a UK bank is subject to the ring-fencing regime) from \u00a325bn to \u00a335bn, exempted predominantly retail-\nfocussed banks from the ring-fencing regime by introducing a secondary threshold (referred to as the trading assets exemption), permitted\nring-fenced banks to establish branches and subsidiaries outside of the UK or the EEA (subject to PRA rules) and introduced a new four-\nyear transition period for UK non-ring-fenced banks to comply with the ring-fencing regime following mergers or acquisitions.\nMarket infrastructure regulation\nIn recent years, regulators as well as global-standard setting bodies such as the International Organisation of Securities Commissions\n(IOSCO) have focused on improving transparency and reducing risk in markets, particularly risks related to over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivative transactions. This focus has resulted in a variety of new regulations across the G20 countries and beyond that require or\nencourage on-venue trading, clearing, posting of margin and disclosure of information related to many derivatives transactions.\nRegulation of benchmarks\nThe UK Benchmarks Regulation applies to the administration, contribution and use of benchmarks within the UK. Financial institutions\nwithin the UK, as applicable, are prohibited from using benchmarks unless their administrators are authorised, registered or otherwise\nrecognised in the UK. This prohibition will apply in respect of third country benchmark administrators from the end of 2030. The phase out\nof LIBOR has now been completed, with the remaining synthetic LIBOR settings for holders of legacy contracts published for the last time\non 30 September 2024. Other global benchmarks are now being phased out through 2025. Global regulators in conjunction with the\nindustry have developed alternative benchmarks and risk-free rate fallback arrangements, including updates to existing, as well as new,\napplicable legislation.\nOther regulation\nConsumer protection, digital access, culture, and diversity and inclusion\nThe FCA\u2019s Consumer Duty is now in force for new and existing products or services that are open to sale or renewal, as well as closed\nproducts and services. The duty sets higher expectations for the standard of care that firms provide to retail customers and impacts all\naspects of Barclays\u2019 retail businesses, including every retail customer journey, product and service as well as Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s\nrelationships with partners, suppliers and third parties. This has resulted in significant implementation costs and there are also continued\nhigher ongoing costs for the industry as a result of extensive monitoring and evidential requirements. In setting out its strategy for\nsupervision of the retail banking industry in 2025, the FCA has reiterated the importance of the Consumer Duty as a continued priority for\nthe FCA and its expectations for firms to embed the Consumer Duty into their culture and purpose.\nOther areas of strategic priority for the FCA\u2019s supervision include the fair treatment of customers in financial difficulty, access for customers\nto payment accounts and banking services (discussed further below), compliance with operational resilience rules, the continued\nmanagement of financial crime and fraud risks, and the role of banks in developing sustainable finance offerings and the importance of\nensuring that sustainability-related claims associated with products are clear, fair and not misleading.\nAlthough the Barclays Bank UK Group never operated in the motor finance market in the UK, the wider financial industry may be impacted\nby the October 2024 Court of Appeal judgments on commission arrangements in the motor finance industry, subject to the result of the\nappeals of those judgments to the Supreme Court, and to the FCA\u2019s ongoing review of the motor finance market.

There could also be wider market and industry\nimplications of the judgments and/or the appeals, which could adversely affect the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results of\noperations, financial condition and prospects.\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s regulators have enhanced their focus on the promotion of cultural values as a key area for banks. The UK\nregulators have also begun focusing on diversity and inclusion in financial services firms, with the PRA and FCA having published a\nconsultation on the introduction of a new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion in September 2023. The FCA has stated that it\nexpects to publish a policy statement on non-financial misconduct by early in 2025, with the FCA and PRA intending to publish policy\nstatements on the remaining diversity and inclusion proposals in Q2 2025.\nThe UK Government is expected to consult on abolishing the Certification Regime that applies under the SMCR and replace this with a\nmore proportionate approach, although details of these proposals are yet to be published.\nFSMA 2023 introduced new provisions under which HM Treasury may designate current account providers that have a significant role in\nthe provision of UK cash access and empowered the FCA to make rules to ensure the reasonable provision of cash access services. In\nSeptember 2024, the FCA introduced new rules which require designated firms to consider the impact of a planned closure of a branch or\nconversion of free-to-use ATMs (cash machines or cashpoints) on their customers\u2019 everyday banking needs and the availability and\nprovision of alternatives. Barclays Bank UK PLC has been designated as a relevant current account provider and is therefore subject to the\nrules.\nFollowing increasing regulatory focus in 2023, the FCA published its findings on the reasons for payment account closures, in light of\nconcerns that customer accounts were being closed on the basis of customers\u2019 political views. In September 2024, the FCA published a\nfollow-up report outlining further findings and expectations for firms, particularly in respect of the Consumer Duty. HM Treasury previously\nannounced plans to require banks to provide clear and tailored reasons for the closure of payment accounts as well as extending the notice\nperiod of such closure to 90 days, although these reforms have not yet been implemented.\nFSMA 2023 contains provisions mandating that the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) require the reimbursement of authorised push\npayment scams by payment service providers, including Barclays. This new reimbursement requirement took effect in October 2024. It has\nimposed a maximum reimbursement limit of \u00a385,000 with costs split 50:50 between the sending and receiving firms.\nData protection\nMost jurisdictions where the Barclays Group operates have adopted or are considering comprehensive laws concerning data protection and\nprivacy. Regulations regarding data protection are increasing in number, as well as levels of enforcement, as manifested in increased\namounts of fines and the severity of other penalties. We expect that personal privacy and data protection will continue to receive attention\nand focus from regulators, as well as public scrutiny and attention. The EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK\u2019s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) provide a framework of rights and duties designed to safeguard personal data and apply to\nthe activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the UK, respectively. The extraterritorial effect of the GDPR and the UK GDPR\nmeans entities established outside the EU or the UK may fall respectively within the GDPR or the UK GDPR\u2019s ambit when offering goods or\nservices to EU/UK based customers or clients or conducting behavioural monitoring of individuals in the EU/UK. The Data (Use and Access)\nBill was introduced to the UK Parliament in October 2024, which if enacted will bring some divergence between the EU GDPR and UK GDPR.\nThe data regime in China is likely to continue to evolve, governing the collection, processing and cross-border transfers of China-based\nindividuals' personal data and restricted data (e.g., macro/derived characteristics data which, if tampered with, divulged or destroyed, may\nendanger China's economic operation, social stability, national security - among other things - having regard to the volume and granularity\nof the data). In India, in preparation for the implementation of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, which passed in 2023, the\nGovernment has yet to issue finalised implementation rules for a robust mechanism of privacy protection and rights. Except under certain\nexemptions, its scope would include the processing of personal data in India and would extend to the profiling of, and offering goods and\nservices to, India-based individuals outside of India. As the global data protection regulatory landscape develops, non-compliance with any\nsuch requirements and rules could lead to regulatory fines and other penalties.\nCybersecurity and operational resilience\nRegulators globally continue to focus on cybersecurity risk management, organisational operational resilience and overall soundness\nacross all financial services firms, with customer and market expectations of uninterrupted access to financial services remaining at an all-\ntime high.\nThe regulatory focus has been further heightened by the increasing number of high-profile ransomware and other supply chain attacks\nseen across the industry in recent years and the growing reliance of financial services on Cloud and other third party service providers. This\nis evidenced by the continuing introduction of new laws and regulatory frameworks directed at enhancing resilience of both firms and their\ncritical third party providers. The UK operational resilience framework introduced in March 2021 requires firms to be able to remain within\nimpact tolerances set for their important business services, in severe but plausible disruption scenarios such as a cyberattack, by no later\nthan 31 March 2025. In December 2024, the FCA and the PRA each published a consultation paper (CP24/28 and CP17/24 respectively)\non proposals for firms to report operational incidents and their material third party arrangements to enhance the operational resilience\nframework.

The FCA has stated that it expects to publish finalised rules in a policy statement in the second half of 2025, whilst the PRA has\nstated that the proposed implementation date for its proposals is no earlier than the second half of 2026.\nRisk review\nSupervision and regulation\nFSMA 2023 introduced a new regime for designated critical third party providers (CTPs). In November 2024, the FCA, PRA, and BoE jointly\nreleased the final rules and expectations for designated CTPs with the final rules having taken effect from 1 January 2025. Whilst the new\nrules apply to designated CTPs themselves, there may be additional impact and costs for the Barclays Bank UK Group incurred in\nconnection with updating existing supplier arrangements to reflect the new CTP requirements where suppliers are designated as critical\nCTPs.\nThe EU\u2019s Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive, which aimed to improve the resilience of network and information systems in\nthe EU against cybersecurity risks, has been updated. The revised version, NIS2, applies from 18 October 2024 and imposes stricter\nsecurity, governance and incident reporting requirements. Failure to comply can lead to significant fines and senior manager liability\namong other things. The extraterritorial effect of NIS2 means entities established outside the EU may fall within its ambit if providing\ncertain services in the EU. In the UK, the original NIS Directive was transposed into UK law and still applies but a new Cyber Security and\nResilience Bill is planned to be introduced to Parliament in 2025.\nThe existing and anticipated requirements specified in the UK, EU, and US for increased controls will serve to improve industry\nstandardisation and resilience capabilities, enhancing the Barclays Group\u2019s ability to deliver services during periods of potential disruption.\nSuch measures are resulting in increased technology and compliance costs for the Barclays Bank UK Group.\nArtificial Intelligence\nA number of jurisdictions where the Barclays Bank UK Group operates have adopted or are considering adopting laws regulating artificial\nintelligence (AI).\nThe EU\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), which entered into force on 1 August 2024, provides rights and duties designed to ensure\nthe safe and ethical deployment of AI. The EU AI Act requires organisations to ensure suitable levels of AI literacy within their workforce\nand categorises AI systems based on their level of risk. It has a phased approach to compliance, with the first set of requirements\nprohibiting certain uses of AI applying from 2 February 2025. It also establishes a rigorous compliance regime for high-risk AI applications\n(which provisions apply from 2 August 2027). The extraterritorial effect of the of EU AI Act means entities established outside the EU fall\nwith the EU AI Act\u2019s ambit if they provide or deploy AI in the EU or the output of their AI is used in the EU.\nRegulatory initiatives on ESG\nIn the UK, the FCA published final rules on the UK Sustainability Disclosure Requirements regime in November 2023 which set out new\nrequirements to prepare sustainability-related product and entity level disclosures for certain firms, as well as a new sustainable investment\nlabelling regime and anti-greenwashing rule applicable to all authorised firms. The new anti-greenwashing rule (and associated guidance)\ncame into force on 31 May 2024 and the labelling regime was made available from 31 July 2024, whilst the disclosure regime continues to\nbe implemented on a phased basis from late 2024 until the end of 2026. The FCA also published a consultation in April 2024 on extending\nthe SDR and investment labels regime to portfolio management and expects to publish a Policy Statement and further information about\nimplementation in Q2 2025.\nThe Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA) received Royal Assent in May 2024, introducing major updates to UK\ncompetition and consumer protection laws. These reforms included the expansion of the powers held by the Competition and Markets\nAuthority (the \u2018CMA\u2019), in relation to digital markets, merger control and antitrust rules, as well as consumer law. Expected to commence in\nspring 2025, the CMA will be able to directly impose significant fines of up to 10% of global turnover for breaches of consumer protection\nlaw. As one of the regulators entrusted with consumer protection in the UK, the CMA has already been actively focusing on misleading\nenvironmental claims, with recent investigations and regulatory action taken in relation to the UK fashion industry for example. The CMA\nhas the ability to investigate potential breaches of consumer protection laws by financial services firms also, and the FCA will be able to\nmake recommendations to the CMA to exercise its powers under the DMCCA. The DMCCA also simplifies and enhances the process by\nwhich the regulators may obtain enforcement orders and undertakings for breaches of consumer law. The Advertising Standards Authority\nis responsible for regulating the content of advertisements, sales promotions and direct marketing in the UK, and has also been focusing on\ngreenwashing, including investigating and making rulings against advertisements from financial services firms due to greenwashing.\nIn its election manifesto, the Government stated that it would mandate UK regulated financial institutions and FTSE 100 companies to\ndevelop and implement credible transition plans that align with the 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement. Consequently, it intends to consult\nin H1 2025 on how best to take that commitment forward. The UK\u2019s Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) concluded its work on a disclosure\nframework for transition plans in October 2024, with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation now assuming\nresponsibility for the TPT\u2019s disclosure materials. It is widely expected that the work of the TPT will likely form the basis of transition plan\ndisclosure requirements mandated by the Government and UK regulators.\nIn September 2024, the Government published information on its framework to create UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (UK SRS).\nSubject to an affirmative endorsement decision, and following a consultation process, the Government would create the first two UK\nSustainability Reporting Standards, based on those of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) (IFRS S1 on general\nrequirements for disclosure of sustainability related financial information and IFRS S2 on climate-related disclosures) and these standards\nwill form part of a wider Sustainability Disclosure Reporting (SDR) framework led by HM Treasury. The Government aims to make its\nendorsement decisions on the first two UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS) in Q1 2025. As there is some overlap between IFRS S2\nand the TPT Disclosure Framework, the FCA plans, through its consultation on implementing UK-endorsed ISSB standards, to consult on\nstrengthening its expectations for transition plan disclosures with reference to the TPT Disclosure Framework, as noted above. In addition,\nTCFD-aligned reporting requirements apply to UK publicly quoted companies, large private companies and LLPs (in addition to existing\nTCFD-related reporting requirements under the UK Listing Rules).", "page_start": 157, "page_end": 158, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

The\nEU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) introduces significant sustainability related reporting obligations covering a wide\nrange of topics beyond climate change for various entities, including EU banks and certain non-EU companies and banks (by virtue of\nhaving EU listings or significant business in the EU), with reporting to commence on a phased basis from the financial year 2024. The\nbreadth of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards and the amount of data to be collected are significant for financial institutions,\nas companies to which finance has been provided are considered to be within scope of their value chain, and thus their reporting.\nIn July 2024, the Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDDD) entered into force, and will require certain EU and non-EU\nentities to carry out due diligence in relation to their own operations and \u2018chain of activities\u2019, in order to identify and prevent, bring to an\nend or mitigate the actual and potential adverse impact of their own operations, the operations of their subsidiaries or of their business\npartners on human rights and the environment. For regulated financial undertakings, the Directive covers own operations and the\nupstream value chain but not the activities of their downstream business partners that receive their financial services and products.\nHowever, the Directive foresees that the EU Commission should submit a report to the EU Parliament and the Council on the necessity to\nlay down additional sustainability due diligence requirements tailored to regulated financial undertakings by July 2026. Moreover, entities in\nscope of the Directive will also be required to adopt and put into effect a climate change mitigation transition plan. These obligations will\napply after transposition into national laws in each EU Member State on a phased basis from July 2027. The EU is currently considering\nproposals to review some parts of CSDDD and other sustainability related legislation, but any proposed amendments remain to be seen.\nSanctions and financial crime\nThe UK Bribery Act 2010 introduced a new form of corporate criminal liability focused broadly on a company\u2019s failure to prevent bribery on\nits behalf. The Criminal Finances Act 2017 introduced new corporate criminal offences of failing to prevent the facilitation of UK and\noverseas tax evasion. In 2023, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 became law. This creates a new offence, in force\nfrom 1 September 2025, of failing to prevent a person associated with the Barclays Bank UK Group from committing fraud for the benefit of\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group. In addition, this legislation also extends the concept of corporate criminal liability. These pieces of legislation\nhave broad application and in certain circumstances may have extraterritorial impact on entities, persons or activities located outside the\nUK.\nThe UK Bribery Act requires the Barclays Bank UK Group to have adequate procedures to prevent bribery which, due to the extraterritorial\nnature of the Act, makes this both complex and costly. Additionally, the Criminal Finances Act requires the Barclays Bank UK Group to have\nreasonable procedures in place to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by persons acting for, or on behalf of, any entity in the\nBarclays Bank UK Group. The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act similarly requires the Barclays Bank UK Group to have\nreasonable procedures in place to prevent a person associated with the Barclays Bank UK Group from committing fraud.\nThe Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (the Sanctions Act) became law in the UK in 2018. Following the UK\u2019s withdrawal\nfrom the EU, the Sanctions Act allowed for the adoption of an autonomous UK sanctions regime which came into force in 2021, as well as a\nmore flexible licensing regime post-Brexit. This regime applies within the UK and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they\nare in the world; it also applies to overseas branches of UK companies.\nIn some cases, US state and federal regulations addressing sanctions, money laundering and other financial crimes may impact entities,\npersons or activities located or undertaken outside the US, including Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries. US government authorities have\naggressively enforced these laws, and expanded authorities threatening the imposition of sanctions, against financial institutions in recent\nyears.\nAs a result of the conflict in Ukraine, there has been an increased regulatory focus on sanctions compliance in various jurisdictions,\nincluding the US, UK and EU.\nFailure of a financial institution to ensure compliance with such laws could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for\nthe institution.", "page_start": 158, "page_end": 159, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to\ncontinue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (\u201cthe going concern period\u201d).\nWe used our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company, the financial services industry, and the general economic environment to\nidentify the inherent risks to the business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group\u2019s and Parent Company\u2019s financial\nresources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that management considered most likely to adversely\naffect the Group\u2019s and Parent Company\u2019s available financial resources over this period and which we challenged were:\n\u2022 the availability of funding and liquidity in the event of a market wide stress scenario; and\n\u2022 the impact on regulatory capital requirements in the event of an economic slowdown.\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the availability of financial resources in the going concern period by comparing\nsevere, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial\nresources indicated by the Group\u2019s financial forecasts.\nOur procedures also included an assessment of whether the going concern disclosure in note 01 to the financial statements gives a\ncomplete and accurate description of the Directors\u2019 assessment of going concern.\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\u2022 we consider that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is\nappropriate;\n\u2022 we have not identified, and concur with the directors\u2019 assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or\nconditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s or Company's ability to continue as a going\nconcern for the going concern period; and\n\u2022 we found the going concern disclosure in note 01 to be acceptable.\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with\njudgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company\nwill continue in operation.\n5 Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations \u2013 ability to detect\nIdentifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (\u201cfraud risks\u201d) we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or\npressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud.

The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working\nwith banks, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved\nour own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group and\nParent Company, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries. The forensic\nspecialists participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussion and were consulted throughout the audit where further\nguidance was deemed necessary.\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit.\nAs required by auditing standards and taking into account our overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to\naddress the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition, which we isolate to certain\nassumptions used in the calculation of the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) on the mortgages portfolio, and the risk that management may be in\na position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgments.\nWe also identified a fraud risk related to qualitative adjustments to the model-driven ECL results given these adjustments are inherently\nuncertain and significant management judgement is involved in estimating these amounts, the valuation of level 3 ESHLA loans held at fair\nvalue given there is significant management judgement around the valuation. and the valuation of the fair value of net assets acquired\nthrough the Tesco Bank acquisition. Further detail in respect of these is set out in section 2 of this report.\nOur audit procedures included evaluating the design and implementation and operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls,\nassessing significant accounting estimates for bias as well as substantive procedures to address the fraud risks.\nThese procedures also included identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting\ndocumentation.\nIncorporating unpredictability into our audit: A requirement of the auditing standards is that we undertake procedures which are\ndeliberately unexpected and could not have reasonably been predicted by Barclays\u2019 management. As an example, we update our criteria for\nselecting journals with a higher risk of management override for testing each year so that the selection criteria do not become predictable.\nIdentifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements. For this\nrisk assessment, matters considered include the following:\n\u2022 our general commercial and sector experience;\n\u2022 discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards);\n\u2022 inspection of the Group\u2019s and Parent Company\u2019s regulatory and legal correspondence;\n\u2022 inspection of the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u2022 relevant discussions with the Group\u2019s and Parent Company\u2019s external legal counsel;\n\u2022 relevant discussions with the Group\u2019s and Parent Company\u2019s key regulatory supervisors including the Prudential Regulation\nAuthority and Financial Conduct Authority; and\n\u2022 the Group\u2019s and Parent Company\u2019s own assessment of the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations and the internal\ncontrols established to mitigate these.\nAs the Group and Parent Company operates in a highly regulated environment, our assessment of risks of material misstatement also\nconsidered the control environment, including the Group and Parent Company\u2019s higher level procedures for complying with regulatory\nrequirements. Our assessment included inspection of key frameworks, policies and standards in place, understanding and evaluating the\nrole of the compliance function in establishing these and monitoring compliance and testing of related controls around whistleblowing and\ncomplaints.\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance\nthroughout the audit.\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\nFirstly, the Group and Parent Company is subject to laws and regulations that directly impact the financial statements including:\n\u2022 financial reporting legislation (including related companies\u2019 legislation);\n\u2022 distributable profits legislation; and\n\u2022 taxation legislation (direct and indirect).", "page_start": 167, "page_end": 168, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

We\nidentified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:\n\u2022 Specific aspects of regulatory capital and liquidity;\n\u2022 Other banking laws and regulations, including securities issuance law;\n\u2022 Customer conduct rules (including the consumer duty)\n\u2022 Money laundering;\n\u2022 Ring-fencing rules;\n\u2022 Sanctions list and financial crime;\n\u2022 Market abuse regulations;\n\u2022 Certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group\u2019s activities.\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the\ndirectors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.

The Barclays Bank UK Group is a major UK financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards,\nand wholesale banking. In addition, separate financial statements have been presented for the parent company.\n2 Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Barclays Bank UK Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays Bank UK PLC,\nhave been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Barclays Bank UK Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays Bank UK PLC,\nhave also been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including\ninterpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, as there are no applicable differences from IFRS as issued by the IASB for\nthe periods presented.\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and separate financial statements are set out below, and\nin the relevant notes to the financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied, with the exception of Classification of\nLiabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1), which was effective from 1 January 2024 and applies retrospectively.\n3 Basis of preparation\nThe consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair\nvaluation of particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.\nThe financial statements are stated in millions of Pounds Sterling (\u00a3m), the functional currency of Barclays Bank UK PLC.\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to\ncompanies using IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board is satisfied that the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup and parent company have the resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from approval of the financial\nstatements.\nIn making this assessment, the Board has considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions and includes a\nreview of a working capital report (WCR). The WCR is used by the Board to assess the future performance of the Barclays Bank UK Group\nand that it has the resources in place that are required to meet its ongoing regulatory requirements. The assessment is based upon\nbusiness plans which contain future projections of profitability taken from the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s medium-term plan as well as\nprojections of regulatory capital requirements and business funding needs. The WCR also includes an assessment of the impact of\ninternally generated stress testing scenarios on the liquidity and capital requirement forecasts. The stress tests used were based upon\nan assessment of reasonably possible downside economic scenarios that the Barclays Bank UK Group could experience.\nThe WCR showed that the Barclays Bank UK Group had sufficient capital in place to support its future business requirements and\nremained above its regulatory minimum requirements in the stress scenarios.

Accounting policies\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s material accounting\npolicies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were\ncritical to preparing those items, are set out under the relevant notes. Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole\nare set out below.\n(i) Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays Bank UK PLC and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are\nentities over which Barclays Bank UK PLC has control. The Barclays Bank UK Group has control over another entity when the Barclays\nBank UK Group has all of the following:\n1) power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights;\n2) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n3) the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\nNone of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s subsidiaries are significant in the context of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s business, results or\nfinancial position. A complete list of all subsidiaries is presented in Note 37.\nIn the individual financial statements of Barclays Bank UK PLC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment.\n(ii) Foreign currency translation\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency\nmonetary balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken\nto the income statement.\n(iii) Financial assets and liabilities\nRecognition\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract. Trade date\nor settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.\nClassification and measurement\nFinancial assets are classified on the basis of two criteria:\ni) the business model within which financial assets are managed; and\nii) their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent \u2018solely payments of principal and interest\u2019 (SPPI)).\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group assesses the business model criteria at a portfolio level. Information that is considered in determining the\napplicable business model includes (i) policies and objectives for the relevant portfolio, (ii) how the performance and risks of the\nportfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management, and (iii) the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales\nexpectation for future periods, and the reasons for such sales.\nThe contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent SPPI.\nTerms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for SPPI are considered, including: (i)\ncontingent and leverage features, (ii) non-recourse arrangements, (iii) features that could modify the time value of money, and (iv)\nSocial, Environmental and Sustainability-linked features. Terms with de-minimis impact do not preclude cash flows from representing\nSPPI.\nThe accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item.

Terms with de-minimis impact do not preclude cash flows from representing\nSPPI.\nThe accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item. The Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 16.\nNotes to the financial statements\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\n1 Material accounting policies (continued)\nDerecognition\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where (i) the\ncontractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or (ii) the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have been\ntransferred (usually by sale) and with them either (a) substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or (b)\nwhere neither substantially all the risks and reward have been transferred or retained, where control over the asset has been lost.\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An exchange of an\nexisting financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms \u2013 generally a difference of 10% or more\nin the present value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment \u2013 is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original\nfinancial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.\nIt may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of a transferred asset, or portion of an asset, have been\ntransferred. It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis that compares the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s exposure to variability in\nasset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer. A cash flow analysis of this nature may require\njudgement. In particular, it is necessary to estimate the asset\u2019s expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this\nexpectation. The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied\ndata used to the greatest extent possible. The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying\nparameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios. Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario. Stressed\nparameters may include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.\nAccounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing\nReverse repurchase agreements (and stock borrowing or similar transactions) are a form of secured lending whereby the Barclays Bank\nUK Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities\nsubject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future. Repurchase agreements are where the Barclays\nBank UK Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group purchases (a reverse repurchase agreement) or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or\nreturn them. The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Barclays Bank UK Group does not acquire the risks and rewards\nof ownership. Consideration paid (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is designated\nor mandatorily at fair value through profit and loss.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group may also sell (a repurchase agreement) or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or\nredeem them. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Barclays Bank UK Group retains substantially all the risks and\nrewards of ownership. Consideration received (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost,\nunless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.\n(iv) Issued debt and equity instruments\nIssued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Barclays Bank\nUK Group having an obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of\nthe instrument.

Cash equivalents comprise loans and advances to banks, cash collateral\nbalances with central banks related to payment schemes and treasury and other eligible bills, all with original maturities of three months\nor less. Investments in debt securities at amortised cost are deemed to be investing activities for the purposes of the cash flow\nstatement, except those instruments considered to be cash equivalents.\n(vi) Accounting for business combinations\nIn accordance with IFRS 3, the Barclays Bank UK Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. Under the\nacquisition method, the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are recognised by the acquirer on the acquisition date, which is\ndetermined to be the date the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree under IFRS 10.\nThe identifiable assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value by the acquirer, unless required otherwise by another\naccounting standard, such as IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits.\nA non-controlling interest, also known as a minority interest, arises where the acquirer does not acquire 100% of the acquiree.\nGoodwill is recognised if the fair value of the consideration transferred is greater than the fair value of the identifiable assets and\nliabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is identified. If the fair\nvalue of consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed then a gain is recognised in\nthe income statement.\nIf the acquisition is incomplete at the end of the reporting period, then the acquirer prepares its financial statements using the\ninformation available. The financial statements are then retrospectively adjusted for new information of facts and circumstances that\nexisted as at the acquisition date becomes available, but the adjustment period may not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n5 New and amended standards and interpretations\nThe accounting policies adopted have been consistently applied, with the exception of the following:\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nIn January 2020 the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 to clarify the presentation of liabilities in the balance sheet, with an effective date\nthat was subsequently deferred to 1 January 2024.\nThe amendments clarify that a liability should be classified as non-current only if the entity has the right to defer settlement of the\nliability for at least 12 months after the reporting period, and that (i) the right to defer settlement must exist at the end of the reporting\nperiod and (ii) management\u2019s intentions or expectations about whether it will exercise its right to defer settlement does not affect the\nclassification. Further clarifications include how lending conditions affect classification and classification of liabilities the entity will or\nmay settle by issuing its own equity instruments.\nIn October 2022, the IASB also issued further amendments to IAS 1 to improve the information an entity provides when its right to defer\nsettlement of a liability for at least 12 months is subject to compliance with covenants, and to respond to stakeholders\u2019 concerns about\nthe classification of such a liability as current or non-current.\nThe impact to the Barclays Bank UK Group from these amendments is not considered to be material.", "page_start": 181, "page_end": 182, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

The amendments include:\n\u2022 additional guidance to clarify when certain financial assets may be compliant with SPPI requirements, including instruments with\ncontingent features (e.g. ESG-linked financing), as well as contractually-linked instruments and non-recourse financing.\n\u2022 clarifying the derecognition requirements for financial assets and financial liabilities, including establishing a new accounting policy\nchoice for derecognition of a financial liability when a payment is initiated by the reporting entity using an electronic payment system\nprovided specified criteria is met.\nThe amendments are effective from 1 January 2026, but are not yet endorsed for use in the UK. The Barclays Bank UK Group is currently\nassessing the impact of these amendments.\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\nIn August 2024, the IASB issued a new IFRS Accounting Standard to replace IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The new\nstandard creates detailed requirements for the classification and aggregation of income and expenses in the income statement, and\ndisclosure requirements for management-defined performance measures.\nThe new standard is effective from 1 January 2027, but has not yet been endorsed for use in the UK. The Barclays Bank UK Group is\ncurrently assessing the impact of these amendments.\nAmendments to IAS 21 - Lack of Exchangeability\nIn August 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 21 to define when a currency is exchangeable into another currency and, when it is\nnot, to determine the exchange rate to use.\nThe amendments are effective from 1 January 2025, however the impact to the Barclays Bank UK Group is not expected to be material.\n6 Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates.

Such fees and costs\nwhere directly attributable and incremental to the origination of the instrument, are deferred on the balance sheet and subsequently\nincluded within the calculation of the effective interest rate. They are amortised to interest income over the period of expected life.\nSimilarly, for mortgage products with distinct periods (initial and follow-on) and contractual margins over the original term wherein the\ninitial contractual margin varies from the average calculated return, additional interest is deferred on the balance sheet and released to\ninterest income over the remaining expected life. This adjustment results in a constant rate of return over contractual rate(s) recognised\nin the income statement.\nThere is judgement involved in application of the effective interest rate (EIR) method for loans measured at amortised cost, in particular\ndeveloping repayment expectations for long dated instruments such as mortgages. Application of the EIR method adjusts the timing and\namount of interest recognition, with qualifying revenue and expenses deferred and recognised through the life of the instrument as well\nas the deferred or accelerated recognition of interest where instruments have contractually specified decreases or increases in the\ncalculation of interest.\nEIR is subject to judgements regarding the rate at which loans are repaid, the key judgement being the prepayment rate following the end\nof the initial discount period, which is informed by internal modelling and reviewed quarterly. The review considers prepayment estimates\nagainst recent observed customer behaviour, with the carrying value of the EIR asset adjusted accordingly.\nEIR calculations are performed at a portfolio level, aggregating financial instruments with similar characteristics and contractual terms.\nThe values in the table below reflect net interest income post application of the EIR method.\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nCash and balances at central banks 1,509 1,878\nDebt securities at amortised cost 708 530\nLoans and advances at amortised cost 8,245 7,015\nFair value through other comprehensive income 1,467 1,099\nOther1 659 502\nInterest and similar income 12,588 11,024\nDeposits at amortised cost (3,684) (2,707)\nDebt securities in issue (251) (414)\nSubordinated liabilities (1,000) (617)\nOther2 (916) (859)\nInterest and similar expense (5,851) (4,597)\nNet interest income 6,737 6,427\nNotes\n1 Includes interest income from cash collateral and reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending at amortised cost and negative interest\non liabilities\n2 Includes interest expense from cash collateral and repurchase agreement and other similar secured lending at amortised cost and negative expense on\nassets\nInterest and similar income presented above represents interest revenue calculated using the effective interest rate method. The EIR\ncalculation in relation to mortgage products requires the Barclays Bank UK Group to predict how long customers will stay on the follow-on\nrate after their initial rate period finishes. If customers are predicted to stay on the follow-on rate for a shorter period, the size of the EIR\nasset reduces. Conversely, if customers are predicted to remain on the follow-on rate for longer, the asset increases.

Brokerage and\nexecution fees are recognised at the point in time the associated service has been completed which is generally the trade date of the\ntransaction.\nContract assets and contract liabilities\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group had no material contract assets or contract liabilities as at 31 December 2024 (2023: \u00a3nil).\nImpairment of fee receivables and contract assets\nDuring 2024, there have been no material impairments recognised in relation to fees receivable and contract assets (2023: \u00a3nil). Fees in\nrelation to transactional business can be added to outstanding customer balances. These amounts may be subsequently impaired as part\nof the overall loans and advances balance.\nRemaining performance obligations\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group applies the practical expedient of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance\nobligations that have original expected durations of one year or less or because the Barclays Bank UK Group has a right to consideration\nthat corresponds directly with the value of the service provided to the client or customer.\nCosts incurred in obtaining or fulfilling a contract\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group expects that incremental costs of obtaining a contract such as success fee and commission fees paid are\nrecoverable and therefore capitalises such contract costs. Capitalised contract costs net of amortisation as at 31 December 2024 are \u00a319m\n(2023: \u00a314m).\nCapitalised contract costs are amortised over the customer relationship period depending on the transfer of services to which the asset\npertains. In 2024, the amount of amortisation was \u00a34m (2023: \u00a33m) and there was no impairment loss recognised in connection with the\ncapitalised contract costs (2023: \u00a3nil).\n5 Net trading (expense)/income\nAccounting for net trading (expense)/income\nTrading positions are held at fair value, and the resulting gains and losses are included in net trading income, together with interest\narising from long and short positions and funding costs relating to trading activities. Incremental costs are reported within net trading\nincome if they are directly attributable to generating identifiable trading income.\nIncome arises from both the sale and purchase of trading positions and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and\nexchange rates and other market variables.\nGains or losses on non-trading financial instruments designated or mandatorily at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the\nincome statement are included in net trading income.\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nNet (losses)/gains from assets and liabilities held for trading1 (45) 17\nNet gains from financial instruments designated at fair value 29 18\nNet trading (expense)/income (16) 35\nNote\n1 Net trading income within Barclays Bank UK Group predominantly comprises gains and losses on derivatives in treasury which are held as economic hedges\nto manage risk and foreign exchange revaluations.\n6 Net investment income/(expense)\nAccounting for net investment income/(expense)\nDividends are recognised when the right to receive the dividend has been established.

Intercompany exposures in the individual financial statements, including loan\ncommitments and financial guarantee contracts, are also in scope of IFRS 9 for ECL purposes.\nAt the reporting date, an allowance (or provision for loan commitments and financial guarantees) is required for the 12-month (Stage\n1) ECLs. If the credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition (Stage 2), or if the financial instrument is credit impaired\n(Stage 3), an allowance (or provision) should be recognised for the lifetime ECLs.\nThe measurement of ECL is calculated using three main components: (i) probability of default (PD) (ii) loss given default (LGD) and (iii)\nthe exposure at default (EAD).\nThe 12-month and lifetime ECLs are calculated by multiplying the respective PD, LGD and the EAD. The 12-month and lifetime PDs\nrepresent the PD occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively. The EAD represents the\nexpected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event\ntogether with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of\ndefault, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and\nthe time value of money.\nExpected credit loss measurement is based on the ability of borrowers to make payments as they fall due. The Barclays Bank UK Group\nalso considers sector-specific risks and whether additional adjustments are required in the measurement of ECL. Credit risk may be\nimpacted by climate considerations for certain sectors, such as oil and gas.\nDetermining a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition:\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group assesses when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on quantitative and qualitative\nassessments. The credit risk of an exposure is considered to have significantly increased when:\ni) Quantitative test\nThe annualised lifetime PD has increased by more than an agreed threshold relative to the equivalent at origination.\nPD deterioration thresholds are defined as percentage increases, and are set at an origination score band and segment level to ensure\nthe test appropriately captures significant increases in credit risk at all risk levels. Generally, thresholds are inversely correlated to the\norigination PD, i.e. as the origination PD increases, the threshold value reduces.\nThe assessment of the point at which a PD increase is deemed \u2018significant\u2019, is based upon analysis of the portfolio\u2019s risk profile against a\ncommon set of principles and performance metrics (consistent across both retail and wholesale businesses), incorporating expert credit\njudgement where appropriate. Application of quantitative PD floors does not represent the use of the low credit risk exemption as\nexposures can separately move into Stage 2 via the qualitative route described below.\nWholesale assets apply a 100% increase in PD and 0.2% PD floor to determine a significant increase in credit risk.\nRetail assets apply bespoke relative increase and absolute PD thresholds based on product type and origination PD. Thresholds are\nsubject to maximums defined by Barclays Bank UK Group policy including absolute PD floor maximum of 0.3% and maximum relative\nPD increase of 400% (applied to strongest credit quality customers only).\nFor existing/historical exposures where origination point scores or data are no longer available or do not represent a comparable\nestimate of lifetime PD, a proxy origination score is defined, based upon:\n\u25aa back-population of the approved lifetime PD score either to origination date or, where this is not feasible, as far back as possible\n(subject to a data start point no later than 1 January 2015); or\n\u25aa use of available historical account performance data and other customer information, to derive a comparable \u2018proxy\u2019 estimation of\norigination PD.", "page_start": 187, "page_end": 189, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

The definition\nand assessment of high risk includes as wide a range of information as reasonably available, such as industry and Group-wide customer\nlevel data, including but not limited to bureau scores and high consumer indebtedness index, wherever possible or relevant.\nWhilst the high risk populations applied for IFRS 9 impairment purposes are aligned with risk management processes, they are also\nregularly reviewed and validated to ensure that they capture any incremental segments where there is evidence of credit deterioration.\niii) Backstop criteria\nThis is relevant for accounts that are more than 30 calendar days past due. The 30 days past due criteria is a backstop rather than a\nprimary driver of moving exposures into Stage 2.\nThe criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk for assets with bullet repayments follows the same principle as all other\nassets, i.e. quantitative, qualitative and backstop tests are all applied.\nExposures will move back to Stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk. This means that, at a\nminimum all payments must be up-to-date, the PD deterioration test is no longer met, the account is no longer classified as high risk,\nand the customer has evidenced an ability to maintain future payments.\nExposures are only removed from Stage 3 and reassigned to Stage 2 once the original default trigger event no longer applies. Exposures\nbeing removed from Stage 3 must no longer qualify as credit impaired, and:\na) the obligor will also have demonstrated consistently good payment behaviour over a 12-month period, by making all consecutive\ncontractual payments due and, for forborne exposures, the relevant EBA defined probationary period has also been successfully\ncompleted or;\nb) (for non-forborne exposures) the performance conditions are defined and approved within an appropriately sanctioned restructure\nplan, including 12 months\u2019 payment history have been met.\nManagement overlays and other exceptions to model outputs are applied only if consistent with the objective of identifying significant\nincreases in credit risk.\nForward-looking information\nThe measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of PD, LGD, a range of unbiased future economic\nscenarios, estimation of expected lives (where contractual life is not appropriate), and estimation of EAD and assessing significant\nincreases in credit risk.\nCredit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument,\ndiscounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). ECLs are the unbiased probability-weighted credit losses determined by evaluating\na range of possible outcomes and considering future economic conditions.\nRefer to the Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis section on page 102 for further details.\nNotes to the financial statements\nFinancial performance and returns\nDefinition of default, credit impaired assets, write-offs, and interest income recognition\nThe definition of default for the purpose of determining ECLs, and for internal credit risk management purposes, has been aligned to the\nRegulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default, to maintain a consistent approach with IFRS 9 and associated regulatory\nguidance. The Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default considers indicators that the debtor is unlikely to pay, includes\nexposures in forbearance and is no later than when the exposure is more than 90 days past due. When exposures are identified as credit\nimpaired at the time when they are purchased or originated, interest income is calculated on the carrying value net of the impairment\nallowance.\nAn asset is considered credit impaired when one or more events occur that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash\nflows of the financial asset. This comprises assets defined as defaulted and other individually assessed exposures where imminent\ndefault or actual loss is identified.\nUncollectible loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s\ninternal processes and when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected. Subsequent recoveries of amounts\npreviously written off are credited to the income statement. The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of subjective\njudgement. Nevertheless, a write-off will often be prompted by a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or other\nformal recovery action, which makes it possible to establish that some or the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery.\nPurchased or originated credit impaired (POCI)\nPurchased or originated credit impaired assets include a fixed pool of credit card and unsecured personal loan balances that were\npurchased as part of the Tesco Bank acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of\norigination to the date of acquisition. Hence, POCI assets do not carry any impairment allowance on initial recognition. All changes in\nlifetime expected credit losses subsequent to the assets\u2019 initial recognition are recognised as an impairment charge. Over time, these\nPOCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or as loans are written off.\nAccounting for purchased financial guarantee contracts\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group may enter into a financial guarantee contract which requires the issuer of such contract to reimburse the\nBarclays Bank UK Group for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of\na debt instrument. For these separate financial guarantee contracts, the Barclays Bank UK Group recognises a reimbursement asset\naligned with the recognition of the underlying ECLs, if it is considered virtually certain that a reimbursement would be received if the\nspecified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument.\nLoan modifications and renegotiations that are not credit-impaired\nWhen modification of a loan agreement occurs as a result of commercial restructuring activity rather than due to the credit risk of the\nborrower, an assessment must be performed to determine whether the terms of the new agreement are substantially different from the\nterms of the existing agreement. This assessment considers both the change in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as\nthe change in overall instrument risk profile. In respect of payment holidays granted to borrowers which are not due to forbearance, if\nthe revised cash flows on a present value basis (based on the original EIR) are not substantially different from the original cash flows,\nthe loan is not considered to be substantially modified.\nWhere terms are substantially different, the existing loan will be derecognised and a new loan will be recognised at fair value, with any\ndifference in valuation recognised immediately within the income statement, subject to observability criteria.\nWhere terms are not substantially different, the loan carrying value will be adjusted to reflect the present value of modified cash flows\ndiscounted at the original EIR, with any resulting gain or loss recognised immediately within the income statement as a modification\ngain or loss.", "page_start": 189, "page_end": 191, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

This is restricted to the maximum contractual life and takes into account\nexpected prepayment, extension, call and similar options. The exceptions are certain revolving financial instruments, such as credit\ncards and bank overdrafts, that include both a drawn and an undrawn component where the entity\u2019s contractual ability to demand\nrepayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entity\u2019s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period.\nFor revolving facilities, expected life is analytically derived to reflect the behavioural life of the asset, i.e. the full period over which the\nbusiness expects to be exposed to credit risk. Behavioural life is typically based upon historical analysis of the average time to default,\nclosure or withdrawal of facility. Where data is insufficient or analysis inconclusive, an additional \u2018maturity factor\u2019 may be incorporated\nto reflect the full estimated life of the exposures, based upon experienced judgement and/or peer analysis. Potential future\nmodifications of contracts are not taken into account when determining the expected life or EAD until they occur.\nDiscounting\nECLs are discounted at the EIR at initial recognition or an approximation thereof and consistent with income recognition. For loan\ncommitments the EIR is the rate that is expected to apply when the loan is drawn down and a financial asset is recognised. Issued\nfinancial guarantee contracts are discounted at the risk-free rate. Lease receivables are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. For\nvariable/floating rate financial assets, the spot rate at the reporting date is used and projections of changes in the variable rate over the\nexpected life are not made to estimate future interest cash flows or for discounting.\nModelling techniques\nCurrently, Internal Ratings-Based models are leveraged to calculate the point-in-time PD and LGD, which serve as key inputs to the IFRS\n9 models. Thereafter, these inputs are extrapolated by the IFRS 9 models to create macroeconomic sensitive forecasts of PDs, LGDs and\nin turn ECL.\nForbearance\nA financial asset is subject to forbearance when it is modified due to the credit distress of the borrower. A modification made to the\nterms of an asset due to forbearance will typically be assessed as a non-substantial modification that does not result in derecognition of\nthe original loan, except in circumstances where debt is exchanged for equity.\nBoth performing and non-performing forbearance assets are classified as Stage 3 except where it is established that the concession\ngranted has not resulted in diminished financial obligation and that no other regulatory definition of default criteria have been triggered,\nin which case the asset is classified as Stage 2. The minimum probationary period for non-performing forbearance is 12 months and for\nperforming forbearance, 24 months. Hence, a minimum of 36 months is required for non-performing forbearance to move out of a\nforborne state.\nNo financial instrument in forbearance can transfer back to Stage 1 until all of the Stage 2 thresholds are no longer met and can only\nmove out of Stage 3 when no longer credit impaired.\nNotes to the financial statements\nFinancial performance and returns\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nIFRS 9 impairment involves several important areas of judgement, including estimating forward-looking modelled parameters (PD, LGD\nand EAD), developing a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimating expected lives and assessing significant increases in\ncredit risk, based on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s experience of managing credit risk. The determination of expected life is most\nmaterial for Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s credit card portfolios which is obtained via behavioural life analysis to materially capture the risk\nof these facilities.\nWithin the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk\ncharacteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, the impairment allowance is calculated using forward-looking\nmodelled parameters which are typically run at account level. There are many models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business\nor customer category. Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed\nor revised. Management adjustments to impairment models, which contain an element of subjectivity, are applied in order to factor in\ncertain conditions or changes in policy that are not fully incorporated into the impairment models, or to reflect additional facts and\ncircumstances at the period end. Management adjustments are reviewed and incorporated into future model development where\nappropriate.\nFor individually significant assets in Stage 3, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations\nthat have a bearing on the expected future cash flows across a range of economic scenarios are taken into account. These\nconsiderations can be particularly subjective and can include the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral,\nthe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration\nof the work-out process. The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future\ncash flows (discounted at the loan\u2019s original effective interest rate), and its carrying amount. Furthermore, judgements change with\ntime as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance\nas individual decisions are taken. Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the\nimpairment charge.\nTemporary adjustments to calculated IFRS 9 impairment allowances may be applied in limited circumstances to account for situations\nwhere known or expected risk factors or information have not been considered in the ECL assessment or modelling process. For further\ninformation, please see page 100 in credit risk performance section.\nInformation about the potential impact of the physical and transition risks of climate change on borrowers is considered, taking into\naccount reasonable and supportable information to make accounting judgements and estimates. Climate change is inherently of a long-\nterm nature, with significant levels of uncertainty, and consequently requires judgement in determining the possible impact in the next\nfinancial year, if any.\n2024 2023\nImpairment Impairment\ncharges/ Recoveries and charges/ Recoveries and\n(releases) reimbursements1 Total2 (releases) reimbursements1 Total\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nLoans and advances at amortised cost3 416 (52) 364 360 (33) 327\nOff-balance sheet loan\ncommitments and financial\nguarantee contracts (12) \u2014 (12) (19) \u2014 (19)\nTotal 404 (52) 352 341 (33) 308\nFinancial instruments at fair value through\nother comprehensive income \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nOther financial asset measured at cost \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nCredit impairment charges /(releases) 404 (52) 352 341 (33) 308\nNotes\n1 Recoveries and reimbursements include \u00a34m (2023: \u00a35m) for reimbursements expected to be received under the arrangement where the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup has entered into financial guarantee contracts which provide credit protection over certain assets with third parties and cash recoveries of previously\nwritten off amounts of \u00a348m (2023: \u00a328m).\n2 Includes net impairment charge of \u00a3209m on the acquisition of Tesco Bank.\n3 Includes Debt securities measured at amortised cost.\nWrite-offs that can still be subjected to enforcement activity\nThe contractual amount outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the year and that can still be subjected to enforcement\nactivity is \u00a3229m (2023: \u00a3186m).

Income tax payable on taxable profits\n(current tax) is recognised as an expense in the periods in which the profits arise. Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes.\nIncome tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable\nby offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior periods. Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have\nbeen enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible\ntemporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are\nrecognised for all taxable temporary differences except for the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is not recognised where the\ntemporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at\nthe time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and\nlegislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is\nrealised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off\nand an intention to settle on a net basis.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group has adopted the International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules amendments to IAS 12, which were\nissued on 23 May 2023 and approved by the UK Endorsement Board on 19 July 2023, and has applied the exception set out in\nparagraph 4A in respect of recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income\ntaxes.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist when it considers that ultimately, in the future, the amount of\nprofit subject to tax may be greater than the amount initially reflected in the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s tax returns.\nA current tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax\nposition will alter the amount of cash tax due to, or from, a tax authority in the future. From recognition, the current tax provision is\nthen measured at the amount the Barclays Bank UK Group ultimately expects to pay the tax authority to resolve the position.\nDeferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts which included consideration for the current view of\nclimate impacts.\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nCurrent tax charge/(credit)\nCurrent year 923 662\nAdjustments in respect of prior years 21 (100)\n944 562\nDeferred tax charge/(credit)\nCurrent year 6 48\nAdjustments in respect of prior years (10) 139\n(4) 187\nTax charge 940 749\nNotes to the financial statements\nFinancial performance and returns\nThe table below shows the reconciliation between the actual tax charge and the tax charge that would result from applying the standard\nUK corporation tax rate to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s profit before tax.\n2024 2024 2023 2023\n\u00a3m % \u00a3m %\nProfit before tax 3,560 2,671\nTax charge based on the standard UK corporation tax rate of 25% 890 25.0% 628 23.5%\n(2023: 23.5%)\nRecurring items:\nBanking surcharge1 and other items 99 2.8% 105 3.9%\nAdjustments in respect of prior years 11 0.3% 39 1.5%\nNon-deductible expenses 10 0.3% 8 0.3%\nImpact of UK bank levy being non-deductible 9 0.2% 7 0.3%\nTax relief on holdings of inflation-linked government bonds (29) (0.8%) (20) (0.8%)\nTax relief on payments made under AT1 instruments (50) (1.4%) (42) (1.6%)\nNon-recurring items:\nNon-deductible provisions for UK customer redress \u2014 \u2014 (5) (0.2%)\nNon-deductible loss on transfer of Wealth Management & Investments \u2014 \u2014 29 1.1%\nportfolio\nTotal tax charge 940 26.4 % 749 28.0%\nNote\n1 Banking surcharge includes the impact of the 3% UK banking surcharge rate on profits and tax adjustments relating to UK banking entities.\nFactors influencing the effective tax rate\nThe effective tax rate of 26.4% is higher than the UK corporation tax rate of 25% primarily due to banking surcharge and other items.\nThese factors, which have each increased the effective tax rate, are partially offset by tax relief on payments made under AT1 instruments.\nA gain of \u00a3558m has arisen on the acquisition of Tesco Bank. The acquisition is expected to generate a gain as a result of the consideration\npayable for net assets being lower than their fair value. The Barclays Bank UK Group considers that the UK corporation tax treatment of\n\u00a3475m of the day 1 gain is unclear. The Barclays Bank UK Group has treated the gain as taxable in preparing its 2024 financial statements\nand intends to engage with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) with a view to achieving clarity of treatment prior to filing Barclays Bank UK\nPLC\u2019s corporation tax return for the year ended 31 December 2024.\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s future tax charge will be sensitive to the tax rates in force and changes to the tax rules in the UK.\nThe global minimum tax rate of 15% introduced by the OECD and G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and a UK\ndomestic minimum tax (the Pillar Two rules) became effective in the UK on 1 January 2024.

In addition, financial assets are held at fair\nvalue through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if the\nfinancial asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business\nmodel that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling.\nBarclays Bank UK Group and PLC\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nLoans and advances 1,543 1,715\nFinancial assets designated at fair value 1,543 1,715\nEquity Securities \u2014 1\nFinancial assets mandatorily at fair value \u2014 1\nTotal 1,543 1,716\nCredit risk of financial assets designated at fair value and related credit derivatives\nThe following table shows the maximum exposure to credit risk, the changes in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk, and the\ncumulative changes in fair value since initial recognition for loans and advances.\nBarclays Bank UK Group and PLC\nMaximum exposure as at Changes in fair value during the Cumulative changes in fair value\n31 December year ended from inception\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nLoans and advances designated at fair\nvalue, attributable to credit risk 1,543 1,715 \u2014 \u2014 (4) (4)\nNotes to the financial statements\nAssets and liabilities held at fair value\n13 Derivative financial instruments\nAccounting for derivatives\nDerivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the\ncontract. They include swaps, forward-rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s net interest income, net trading income and derivative assets and liabilities. Notional amounts of the contracts\nare not recorded on the balance sheet.\nAll derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives that are in a designated cash flow hedge\naccounting relationship. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is\nnegative.\nHedge accounting\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge\naccounting purposes. The Barclays Bank UK Group applies hedge accounting to represent the economic effects of its interest rate,\ncurrency and contractually linked inflation risk management strategies. Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and\nwhen transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Barclays Bank UK Group applies fair value\nhedge accounting and cash flow hedge accounting.\nFair value hedge accounting\nChanges in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together\nwith changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The fair value changes adjust the\ncarrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.\nIf hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges of\ninterest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the\npreviously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair\nvalue adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement. For items classified as fair value through other comprehensive\nincome, the hedge accounting adjustment is included in other comprehensive income.\nCash flow hedge accounting\nFor qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised\ninitially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect\nprofit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain\nor loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income\nstatement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is\nimmediately transferred to the income statement.\nTotal derivatives Barclays Bank UK Group Barclays Bank UK PLC\nNotional Notional\ncontract Fair value contract Fair value\namount Assets Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nAs at 31 December 2024\nTotal derivative assets/(liabilities) held for trading 589,637 155 (163) 590,131 155 (182)\nTotal derivative assets/(liabilities) held for risk\nmanagement 76,059 1,746 (137) 76,059 1,746 (137)\nDerivative assets/(liabilities) 665,696 1,901 (300) 666,190 1,901 (319)\nAs at 31 December 2023\nTotal derivative assets/(liabilities) held for trading 619,446 249 (311) 619,927 249 (340)\nTotal derivative assets/(liabilities) held for risk\nmanagement 70,995 1,317 (87) 70,995 1,317 (87)\nDerivative assets/(liabilities) 690,441 1,566 (398) 690,922 1,566 (427)\nFurther information on netting arrangements of derivative financial instruments can be found within Note 17.", "page_start": 197, "page_end": 199, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

In these instances, a proxy hedging solution can be utilised whereby portfolios of floating rate assets are designated as\neligible hedged items in cash flow hedges.\nIn some hedging relationships, the Barclays Bank UK Group designates risk components of hedged items as follows:\n\u25aa Benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the Risk Free Rate (RFR) component\n\u25aa Inflation risk as a contractually specified component of a debt instrument\n\u25aa Exchange rate risk for foreign currency financial assets or financial liabilities\n\u25aa Components of cash flows of hedged items, for example certain interest payments for part of the life of an instrument\nUsing the benchmark interest rate risk results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting\nrelationship.\nIn respect of many of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s hedge accounting relationships, the hedged item and hedging instrument change\nfrequently due to the dynamic nature of the risk management and hedge accounting strategy. The Barclays Bank UK Group applies hedge\naccounting to dynamic scenarios, predominantly in relation to interest rate risk, with a combination of hedged items in order for its\nfinancial statements to reflect as closely as possible the economic risk management undertaken. In some cases, if the hedge accounting\nobjective changes, the relevant hedge accounting relationship is de-designated and a de-designated relationship is replaced with a different\nhedge accounting relationship.\nThe hedging instruments share the same risk exposures as the hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is determined with reference to\nquantitative tests, predominantly regression testing, but to the extent hedging instruments are exposed to different risks than the hedged\nitems, this could result in hedge ineffectiveness or hedge accounting failures.\nSources of ineffectiveness include the following:\n\u25aa Mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument, including basis differences\n\u25aa Changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments\n\u25aa Cash flow hedges using external swaps with non-zero fair values\nNotes to the financial statements\nAssets and liabilities held at fair value\nHedged items in fair value hedges\nAccumulated fair value\nadjustment included in carrying\nBarclays Bank UK Group and PLC amount\nOf which:\nAccumulated\nfair value\nadjustment on Change in fair Hedge\nitems no value used as ineffectiveness\nlonger in a a basis to recognised in\nCarrying hedge determine the income\namount Total relationship ineffectiveness statement1\nHedged item statement of financial position classification and risk\ncategory \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\n2024\nAssets\nLoans and advances at amortised cost\n\u2013 Interest rate risk 1,684 (3,693) (1,785) (830) 18\nDebt securities classified at amortised cost\n\u2013 Interest rate risk 551 (2) \u2014 12 3\n\u2013 Inflation risk 1,752 (58) (39) 23 (11)\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive\nincome\n\u2013 Interest rate risk 17,778 (219) 29 6 50\n\u2013 Inflation risk 5,498 (158) (54) (54) (13)\nTotal assets 27,263 (4,130) (1,849) (843) 47\nLiabilities\nSubordinated liabilities\n- Interest rate risk (12,382) 564 103 38 (5)\nDebt securities in issue\n- Interest rate risk (973) 70 (7) (18) (18)\nTotal liabilities (13,355) 634 96 20 (23)\nTotal hedged items 13,908 (3,496) (1,753) (823) 24\n2023\nAssets\nLoans and advances at amortised cost\n\u2013 Interest rate risk 2,712 (3,040) (1,863) 79 12\nDebt securities classified at amortised cost\n\u2013 Inflation risk 1,659 (81) (60) (63) (8)\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive\nincome\n\u2013 Interest rate risk 9,553 (219) (8) 283 42\n\u2013 Inflation risk 3,129 (151) (115) (89) (13)\nTotal assets 17,053 (3,491) (2,046) 210 33\nLiabilities\nSubordinated liabilities\n\u2013 Interest rate risk (11,215) 525 151 (306) 3\nDebt securities in issue\n\u2013 Interest rate risk (1,000) 87 (9) (63) (14)\nTotal liabilities (12,215) 612 142 (369) (11)\nTotal hedged items 4,838 (2,879) (1,904) (159) 22\nNote\n1 Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in net interest income.\nFor items classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment is not included in the carrying\namount, but rather adjusts other comprehensive income.", "page_start": 201, "page_end": 203, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Interest (calculated using the\neffective interest method) is recognised in the income statement in net interest income (Note 3). Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or\nloss recognised in other comprehensive income is included in net investment income / (expense) (Note 6).\nIn determining whether the business model is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, it is\ndetermined that both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are integral to achieving the objective of the business\nmodel.

Movements in own credit are reported through\nother comprehensive income, unless the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in\nprofit and loss. In these scenarios, all gains and losses on that liability (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability) are\npresented in profit and loss. On derecognition of the financial liability no amount relating to own credit risk is recycled to the income\nstatement. The Barclays Bank UK Group has the ability to make the fair value designation when holding the instruments at fair value\nreduces an accounting mismatch (caused by an offsetting liability or asset being held at fair value), or is managed by the Barclays Bank\nUK Group on the basis of its fair value, or includes terms that have substantive derivative characteristics (Note 13).\nThe details on how the fair value amounts are arrived at for financial liabilities designated at fair value are described in Note 16.\nBarclays Bank UK Group and PLC\n2024 2023\nContractual Contractual\namount due amount due\nFair value on maturity Fair value on maturity\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nDebt securities 2,848 2,849 196 196\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value 2,848 2,849 196 196\n16 Fair value of financial instruments\nAccounting for financial assets and liabilities \u2013 fair value\nFinancial instruments that are held for trading are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In addition, financial assets are held at\nfair value through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if\nthe financial asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business\nmodel that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling. Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are\nrecognised in the income statement in net investment income, except if reporting it in trading income reduces an accounting mismatch.\nWherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument. For many of the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup\u2019s financial assets and liabilities for which quoted prices are not available, valuation models are used to estimate fair value. The\nmodels calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present\nvalue. These models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves and currency\nrates. For financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads\nderived from observable market data such as in primary issuance and redemption activity for structured notes.\nOn initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active\nmarket to the contrary.\nFor valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price\n(Day one profit) is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction; or over the period until all\ninputs will become observable where appropriate; or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.\nVarious factors influence the availability of observable inputs, and these may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors\ninclude the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the\nmarketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic). To the extent that valuation is\nbased on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on\nthe significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information\navailable, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities, or other analytical techniques.\nThe sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 210.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation\nmodels make use of unobservable inputs (Level 3 assets and liabilities). This note provides information on these instruments, including\nthe related unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable inputs,\nand a sensitivity analysis.\nClimate-related risks are assumed to be included in the fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets. Within less active\nmarkets, for counterparties and instruments identified as being more susceptible to climate change risk, an impact assessment was\nperformed through increasing their probability of default.

An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume\nand frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nValuation technique using observable inputs \u2013 Level 2\nAssets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable either directly or indirectly.\nValuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard\npricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are\nobservable.\nValuation technique using significant unobservable inputs \u2013 Level 3\nAssets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data\n(unobservable inputs). A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if\nthere is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. Unobservable input levels are generally determined via\nreference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.\nThe following table shows Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s assets and liabilities that are held at fair value disaggregated by valuation technique\n(fair value hierarchy) and balance sheet classification:\nAssets and liabilities held at fair value\n2024 2023\nValuation technique using Valuation technique using\nBarclays Bank UK Group Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAs at 31 December \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nTrading portfolio assets 180 62 \u2014 242 43 \u2014 \u2014 43\nFinancial assets at fair value through the\nincome statement \u2014 79 1,464 1,543 \u2014 87 1,629 1,716\nDerivative financial assets \u2014 1,901 \u2014 1,901 \u2014 1,566 \u2014 1,566\nFinancial assets at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income 6,892 20,092 61 27,045 9,168 10,943 298 20,409\nTotal assets 7,072 22,134 1,525 30,731 9,211 12,596 1,927 23,734\nTrading portfolio liabilities (661) (65) \u2014 (726) (894) (14) \u2014 (908)\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value \u2014 (2,848) \u2014 (2,848) \u2014 (196) \u2014 (196)\nDerivative financial liabilities \u2014 (300) \u2014 (300) \u2014 (398) \u2014 (398)\nTotal liabilities (661) (3,213) \u2014 (3,874) (894) (608) \u2014 (1,502)\nAssets and liabilities held at fair value are materially similar between Barclays Bank UK Group and Barclays Bank UK PLC.\nAssets and liabilities reclassified between Level 1 and Level 2\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2024, there were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 (year ended 31 December 2023:\nthere were no material transfers between Level 1 and Level 2).\nNotes to the financial statements\nAssets and liabilities held at fair value\nLevel 3 movement analysis\nThe following table summarises the movements in the Level 3 balances during the year.

Unobservable loan spreads are determined by\nincorporating funding costs, the level of comparable assets such as gilts, issuer credit quality and other factors.\nLevel 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity of fixed rate loans is calculated by applying a shift to loan spreads, aligned to the prudent valuation\nframework for calculating market data uncertainty around an unobservable valuation input. The prudent valuation framework additionally\nrequires Barclays Bank UK PLC to be capitalised to 50% of the impact of such valuation uncertainty being realised in the income statement.\nOn a portfolio level, the sensitivity is equivalent to an average stress to the input loan spread of 19 bps.\nCorporate Debt\nDescription: Primarily corporate bonds.\nValuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable\npricing sources.\nObservability: Prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable.

Points are a percentage of par; for example, 100 points\nequals 100% of par. A basis point equals 1/100th of 1%; for example, 150 basis points equals 1.5%.\nThe following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value\nmeasurement of the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs. Where\nsensitivities are described, the inverse relationship will also generally apply.\nWhere reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement, a description of\nthose interrelationships is included below.\nLoan Spread\nLoan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Loan spreads\ntypically reflect credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a discounted\ncash flow calculation.\nThe ESHLA portfolio primarily consists of long-dated fixed rate loans extended to counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and\nLocal Authority sectors. The loans are mostly categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their illiquid nature and the\nsignificance of unobservable loan spreads to the valuation. Valuation uncertainty arises from the long-dated nature of the portfolio, the lack\nof secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads. The majority of ESHLA loans are to borrowers in heavily\nregulated sectors that are considered low credit risk and have a history of near zero defaults since inception and where Barclays Bank UK\nGroup is often afforded a position as a secured creditor. While the overall loan spread range is from 35 bps to 291 bps (2023: 40bps to\n307bps), the vast majority of spreads are concentrated towards the bottom end of this range, with 97% of the loan notional being valued\nwith spreads less than 200 bps for the current period.\nIn general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a fair value decrease for a loan.\nComparable Price\nComparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a\ncomparable observable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to account for relevant differences such as maturity or credit\nquality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable and unobservable instruments in order to establish a\nvalue.\nIn general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in an increase in the price of the unobservable instrument.", "page_start": 209, "page_end": 210, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

The reduction in the unfavourable impact year-on-year is attributable to\nmarket moves in interest rates. A methodology asymmetry in calculating the favourable and unfavourable changes in the sensitivity\nanalysis exists and is attributable to Investing and Funding costs contributing to the unfavourable side only. This can result in asymmetric\nnumerical outcomes for favourable and unfavourable sensitivities.\nPortfolio exemptions\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of\nfinancial assets and liabilities. Financial instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position (i.e. an\nasset) for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position (i.e. a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions. Accordingly, the Barclays Bank UK Group\nmeasures the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk\nexposure at the measurement date.\nUnrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs\nThe amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price (the fair value at initial\nrecognition) and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less\namounts subsequently recognised, is \u00a36m (2023: \u00a36m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and \u00a3156m (2023: \u00a3174m) for\nfinancial instruments carried at amortised cost.

As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate to\ndirectly compare this fair value information to independent market sources or other financial institutions. Different valuation\nmethodologies and assumptions can have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.\nFinancial assets\nDebt Securities at amortised cost\nDebt Securities at amortised cost are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other\nreliable pricing sources. Prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable. Where market data for the underlying bond is\nunavailable, a number of proxy/extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate fair value.\nLoans and advances at amortised cost\nThe fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that\nreflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality. Where market data or credit information on the underlying\nborrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy/extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates.\nReverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending\nThe fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully\ncollateralised.\nFinancial liabilities\nDeposits at amortised cost\nIn many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short-term in nature or have interest rates\nthat reprice frequently, such as customer accounts, other deposits, and short-term debt securities.\nThe fair value for deposits with longer-term maturities, mainly time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either\nmarket rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Consequently, the fair value discount is minimal.\nRepurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing\nThe fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.\nDebt securities in issue\nFair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available or, where the instruments are short dated, carrying\namount approximates fair value.\nSubordinated liabilities\nFair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issuer concerned\nor issuers with similar terms and conditions.\n17 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group reports financial assets and financial liabilities on a net basis on the balance sheet only if there is a legally\nenforceable right to set-off the recognised amounts and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the\nliability simultaneously.

The right of use asset will amortise to the income statement over the life of the lease.\nOn the balance sheet, the ROU assets are included within property, plant and equipment and the lease liabilities are included within other\nliabilities.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group and Barclays Bank UK PLC apply the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 for leases with a term not exceeding\n12 months. For these leases the lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another\nsystematic basis is more appropriate.\nAs a lessee\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group and Barclays Bank UK PLC lease various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable lease\narrangements to meet their operational business requirements. In some instances, Barclays Bank UK Group and Barclays Bank UK PLC will\nsublease property to third parties when it is no longer needed to meet business requirements. Currently, Barclays Bank UK Group and\nBarclays Bank UK PLC do not have any material subleasing arrangements.\nROU asset balances relate to property leases only. Refer to Note 18 for the carrying amount of ROU assets.\nNotes to the financial statements\nAssets at amortised cost and other investments\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group and Barclays Bank UK PLC recognised a total expense of \u00a31m (2023: \u00a31m) for short term leases during the\nyear.

The\ntest involves comparing the carrying value of a cash generating unit (CGU) including goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash\nflows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGU\u2019s fair value if\nthis is higher.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured\nreliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits\nattributable to the assets will flow from their use.\nFor internally generated intangible assets, only costs incurred during the development phase are capitalised. Expenditure in the research\nphase is expensed when it is incurred.\nIntangible assets are stated at cost (which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value) less\naccumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the\npattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally using the amortisation periods set out below:\nAnnual rates in calculating amortisation Amortisation period\nGoodwill Not amortised\nOther Software 12 months to 6 years\nCore Deposits 12 months to 5 years\nBrand 12 months to 10 years\nCustomer lists 12 months to 25 years\nLicences and other 12 months to 25 years\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.

Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of\nimpairment testing. The review of goodwill for impairment involves calculating a value in use (VIU) valuation which is compared to the\ncarrying value of a CGU associated with the goodwill to determine whether any impairment has occurred. This includes the\nidentification of independent CGUs across the organisation and the allocation of goodwill to those CGUs.\nThe calculation of a value in use contains a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the future cash flows and the rates used to discount\nthem. Key judgements include determining the carrying value of the CGU, the cash flows and discount rates used in the calculation.\n\u2022 The cash flow forecasts used by management involve judgement and are based upon a view of the future prospects of the business\nand market conditions at the point in time the assessment is prepared, including the potential effect of climate change. The\nestimation of cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-\nterm sustainable cash flows.\n\u2022 The discount rates applied to the future cash flows also involve judgement. The discount rates used are compared to market\nparticipants to ensure that they are appropriate and based on an estimated cost of equity for each CGU.\n\u2022 The choice of a terminal growth rate used to determine the present value of the future cash flows of the CGUs is also a judgement\nthat can impact the outcome of the assessment. The terminal growth rate and discount rates used may vary due to external market\nrates and economic conditions that are beyond management\u2019s control, including the potential effect of climate change.\nFurther details of some of the key judgements are set out below.\n2024 impairment review\nThe 2024 impairment review was performed during Q4 2024, with the approach and results of this analysis set out below.\nDetermining the carrying value of CGUs\nThe carrying value for each CGU is the sum of the tangible equity, goodwill and intangible asset balances associated with that CGU.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group manages the assets and liabilities of its CGUs with reference to the tangible equity of the respective\nbusinesses. That tangible equity is derived from the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in the CGU\nand therefore reflects its relative risk, as well as the level of capital that management considers a market participant would be required to\nhold and retain to support business growth.\nGoodwill is initially allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition that generated it.\nGoodwill is only reallocated if there is a change in its use or when reporting structures are altered in a way that changes the composition of\none or more cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The goodwill allocated to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s CGUs is\nunchanged in the year. The intangible asset balances are allocated to the CGUs based upon their expected usage of these assets.\nCash flows\nThe five-year cash flows used in the value in use calculation are based on the formally agreed medium-term plans approved by the Board.\nThese are prepared using macroeconomic assumptions which management considers reasonable and supportable, and reflect business\nagreed initiatives for the forecast period. The macroeconomic assumptions underpinning the medium-term plan were determined\nduring 2024 and management has considered whether there are subsequent significant changes in those assumptions which would\nadversely impact the results of the impairment review.\nAs required by IAS 36, all estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring\ninitiatives where a constructive obligation to carry out the plan does not yet exist.\nIn line with prior year treatment, the Education, Social Housing and Local Authority (ESHLA) portfolio has been excluded from the Business\nBanking CGU cash flows. This is a legacy loan portfolio which is not part of the business to which the goodwill relates. As such, the cash\nflows relating to this portfolio have been excluded from the Business Banking VIU calculation.\nDiscount rates\nIAS 36 requires that the discount rate used in a value in use calculation reflects the pre-tax rate an investor would require if they were to\nchoose an investment that would generate similar cash flows to those that the entity expects to generate from the asset. In determining the\ndiscount rate, management identified the costs of equity associated with market participants that closely resemble the Barclays Bank UK\nGroup's CGUs. The cost of equity has been used as the discount rate in the 2024 impairment assessment and applied to the post tax cash\nflows of the CGU. This post-tax method incorporates the impact of changing tax rates on the cash flows and is expected to produce the\nsame VIU result as the pre-tax method adjusted for varying tax rates. Using the resultant VIU the equivalent pre-tax discount rate has been\ncalculated. The cost of equity rate used for all CGUs in this year\u2019s calculation has been increased to reflect the relative volatility of Barclays\nPLC\u2019s stock price versus the average of its peers. The range of equivalent pre-tax discount rates applicable across the CGUs are from\n18.25% to 19.22% (2023: 17.40% to 18.55%).\nTerminal growth rate\nThe terminal growth rate is used to estimate the effect of projecting cash flows to the end of an asset\u2019s useful economic life. It is\nmanagement\u2019s judgement that the cash flows associated with the CGUs will grow in line with the UK economy in which the Barclays Bank\nUK Group operates.

As at 31 December 2024, the goodwill within Personal Banking was \u00a33,029m (2023: \u00a33,029m),\nof which \u00a32,501m (2023: \u00a32,501m) was attributable to Woolwich, and within Business Banking the goodwill was \u00a3629m (2023: \u00a3629m),\nfully attributable to Woolwich. The recoverable amounts for Personal Banking and Business Banking have decreased in comparison to the\n2023 impairment review. Barclaycard Consumer UK has an increased recoverable amount, compared to 2023 where the value in use had\nreduced to a level such that an adverse movement in any of the key judgement areas would have resulted in an impairment. The changes\nin the headroom (value in use less the carrying value) in the year are reflective of expected changes in the interest rate and macroeconomic\noutlook.\nBased on management\u2019s plans and assumptions, no impairment has been recognised.\nThe outcomes of the impairment reviews for the Personal Banking, Business Banking and Barclaycard Consumer UK CGUs are set out\nbelow:\nValue in use Value in use\nexceeding exceeding\ncarrying value carrying value\nCash generating unit Tangible equity Goodwill Intangibles Carrying value Value in use 2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nPersonal Banking 7,702 3,029 112 10,843 13,257 2,414 3,211\nBusiness Banking 1,940 629 \u2014 2,569 5,689 3,120 3,258\nBarclaycard Consumer UK 1,891 179 2 2,072 2,267 195 \u2014\nTotal 11,533 3,837 114 15,484 21,213 5,729 6,469\nSensitivity of key judgements\nThe CGUs are sensitive to possible adverse changes in the key assumptions that support the recoverable amount:\nCash flows: The medium-term plans used to determine the cash flows used in the VIU calculation rely on macroeconomic forecasts,\nincluding interest rates, GDP and unemployment, and forecast levels of customers activity. Interest rate assumptions impact planned cash\nflows from both customer income and structural hedge contributions and therefore cash flow expectations are highly sensitive to\nmovements in the yield curve. The cash flows also contain assumptions with regard to the prudential and financial conduct regulatory\nenvironment which may be subject to change. A sensitivity analysis has been provided to illustrate the impact of a 10% reduction in cash\nflows.\nDiscount rate: The discount rate should reflect the market risk-free rate adjusted for the inherent risks of the business it is applied to.\nManagement has identified discount rates for comparable businesses and consider these to be a reasonable estimate of a suitable market\nrate for the profile of the business unit being tested. The risk that these discount rates may not be appropriate is quantified below by\nshowing the impact of a 100bps increase in the discount rate.\nTerminal growth rate: The terminal growth rate is used to estimate the cash flows into perpetuity based on the expected longevity of the\nCGU\u2019s businesses. The terminal growth rate is sensitive to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The risk that using inflation\ndata may not be appropriate for its determination is quantified below and shows the impact of a 100bps decrease in the terminal growth\nrate is shown.\nAllocated capital rate: Tangible equity is allocated based on the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in\nthe CGU which is dependent on the relative risk of businesses. The capital ratio used in determining the level of tangible equity allocated to\nthe CGU and its capital cash flows could move over time as a result of a change to the prudential regulatory environment or the risk profile\nof the business. The impact of a 50bps increase in capital ratio is quantified below.\nThe sensitivity of the value in use to key judgements in the calculations for certain CGUs holding goodwill balances is set out below:\nChange required to reduce headroom to\nReduction in headroom zero\n50bps\n100bps 100bps increase\nValue in use increase in decrease in to 10%\nexceeding Terminal the terminal allocated reduction in Terminal Allocated\nCash generating Carrying Value in carrying Discount growth discount growth capital forecasted Discount growth Capital Cash\nunit value use value rate rate rate rate rate cash flows rate rate rate flows\n\u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m % % \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m % % % %\nPersonal\nBanking 10,843 13,257 2,414 19.2 2.0 (1,109) (761) (351) (1,525) 2.4 (3.9) 3.4 (15.8)\nBusiness\nbanking 2,569 5,689 3,120 19.2 2.0 (474) (323) (102) (655) 12.7 (32.9) 15.4 (47.6)\nBarclaycard\nConsumer\nUK 2,072 2,267 195 18.2 2.0 (204) (138) (79) (257) 1.0 (1.5) 1.2 (7.6)\nTotal 15,484 21,213 5,729", "page_start": 221, "page_end": 222, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Identifying whether a present obligation\nexists and estimating the probability, timing, nature and quantum of the outflows that may arise from past events requires judgements\nto be made based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events and often requires specialist professional advice.\nWhen matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements and estimates can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty\ninvolved. Management continues to monitor matters as they develop to re-evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be\nrecognised, however there can remain a wide range of possible outcomes and uncertainties, particularly in relation to legal, competition\nand regulatory matters, and as a result it is often not practicable to make meaningful estimates even when matters are at a more\nadvanced stage.\nThe amount that is recognised as a provision can also be very sensitive to the assumptions made in calculating it. This gives rise to a\nlarge range of potential outcomes which require judgement in determining an appropriate provision level.

The extent of the\nimpact of these matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects.\nMatters arising from a set of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the\nrelevant facts and circumstances.\nThe recognition of provisions in relation to such matters involves critical accounting estimates and judgements in accordance with the\nrelevant accounting policies applicable to Note 22, Provisions. We have not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial impact or effect\non the Barclays Bank UK Group of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so. Various matters detailed in this note\nseek damages of an unspecified amount. While certain matters specify the damages claimed, such claimed amounts do not necessarily\nreflect the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s potential financial exposure in respect of those matters.\nHM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) assessments concerning UK Value Added Tax\nIn 2018, HMRC issued notices that have the effect of either removing certain Barclays overseas subsidiaries that have operations in the UK\nfrom Barclays\u2019 UK VAT group or preventing them from joining it. Supplies between members of a UK VAT group are generally free from\nVAT. The notices had both retrospective and prospective effect. Barclays appealed HMRC\u2019s decisions to the First-Tier Tribunal (Tax\nChamber) in relation to both the retrospective VAT assessments and the ongoing VAT payments made since 2018. \u00a3181m of VAT\n(inclusive of interest) was assessed retrospectively by HMRC covering the periods 2014 to 2018, of which approximately \u00a3128m is\nexpected to be attributed to Barclays Bank UK PLC and \u00a353m to Barclays Bank PLC. This retrospectively assessed VAT was paid in 2018 and\nan asset, adjusted to reflect expected eventual recovery, is recognised. Since 2018 Barclays has paid, and recognised as an expense, VAT on\nintra-group supplies from the relevant subsidiaries to the members of the VAT group. In respect of the ongoing VAT payments, the court\nupheld HMRC\u2019s denial of the VAT grouping in August 2024. Barclays has appealed this decision to the Upper Tribunal.\nFCA investigation concerning financial crime systems and controls and compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007\nThe FCA is conducting a civil enforcement investigation into Barclays Bank UK PLC\u2019s and Barclays Bank PLC\u2019s compliance with the Money\nLaundering Regulations 2007 and the FCA\u2019s Principles of Business and Rules relating to anti-money laundering and financial crime systems\nand controls.

Barclays\nBank PLC, a fellow subsidiary of Barclays PLC, is the principal employer of the UKRF. In the event of Barclays Bank PLC\u2019s insolvency during\nthis period provision has been made to require Barclays Bank UK PLC to become the principal employer of the UKRF. Barclays Bank PLC\u2019s\nSection 75 debt would be triggered by the insolvency (the debt would be calculated after allowing for the payment to the UKRF of any\ncollateral above). To meet the requirements of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Banking Reform) (Pensions) Regulations 2015\nit is Barclays\u2019 intention to sectionalise the UKRF in July 2025, creating two separate sections \u2013 the Barclays Bank Section and the Barclays UK\nSection (with Barclays Bank UK PLC participating in the Barclays UK Section only). This will not change the financial position of the UKRF\nfrom a consolidated Barclays PLC Group perspective, and members\u2019 benefits will be unchanged as a result of the actions Barclays is taking\nto meet its regulatory obligations.\nUnder IAS 19, the UKRF is a defined benefit plan that shares risks between entities under common control. Barclays Bank PLC accounts for\nthe defined benefit obligation and Barclays Bank UK PLC recognises a cost equal to its contributions to the scheme. In accordance with\naccounting standards, Barclays Bank UK PLC does not account for any potential additional liability to the scheme at the end of the\ntransitional phase.\nNotes to the financial statements\nEmployee benefits\n29 Share-based payments\nAccounting for share-based payments\nEmployee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase\nshares on favourable terms. The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in\nthe income statement over the period that employees provide services. The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of\nshares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.\nThe number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in\nthe terms of the awards will be met. For other share-based payment schemes such as Sharesave and Sharepurchase, there are non-\nvesting conditions which must be met. Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration\nof recognition of the cost of the employee services.\nThe fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability. The\nfair value of options granted is determined using the Black-Scholes model to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest. The model\ntakes into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share\nprice over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also\nreflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions \u2013 such as continuing to make payments into a share-\nbased savings scheme.\nThe charge for the year arising from share based payment schemes was as follows:\nCharge for the year\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nShare Value Plan and Deferred Share Value Plan 7 5\nOthers 16 16\nTotal Equity settled 23 21\nCash Settled \u2014 \u2014\nTotal share based payments 23 21\nThe terms of the main current plans are as follows:\nShare Value Plan (SVP)\nSVP awards have been granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of\nBarclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three, four, five or seven years.

Detail is also given on securitisation\ntransactions the Barclays Bank UK Group has entered into and arrangements that are held off-balance sheet.\n30 Structured entities\nA structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. Voting\nrights may relate to administrative tasks only, with the relevant activities of the entity being directed by means of contractual\narrangements. Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined objective with restrictions around their\nongoing activities.\nDepending on the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own\nreturns, it may consolidate the entity. In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.\nConsolidated structured entities\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of\nconsolidated structured entities:\nSecuritisation vehicles\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer. Refer to Note 31 for further detail.\nUnconsolidated structured entities\nThe term \u2018unconsolidated structured entities\u2019 refers to structured entities not controlled by the Barclays Bank UK Group, and are established\nby the Barclays Bank UK Group or a third party. An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement\nwhich creates variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Barclays Bank UK Group. Such interests include\nholding of debt or equity securities, lending, loan commitments and financial guarantees.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate\ncustomer transactions, to provide risk management services and for specific investment opportunities. Structured entities may take the\nform of funds, trusts, securitisation vehicles, and private investment companies. The largest transactions for Barclays Bank UK Group\ninclude holding notes issued by securitisation vehicles, loans to trusts, and facilitating customer requirements through funds. As at\n31 December 2024, Barclays entered into transactions with approximately 217 (2023: 145) structured entities.\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s interests in structured entities are set out below, summarised by the nature of the interest and limited to\nsignificant categories, based on maximum exposure to loss.\nSummary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities\nLending Other Total1\nAs at 31 December 2024 \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\nFinancial assets at fair value through the income statement 27 \u2014 27\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \u2014 719 719\nLoans and advances at amortised cost 597 \u2014 597\nDebt securities at amortised cost \u2014 8,893 8,893\nOther assets \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nTotal on-balance sheet exposures 624 9,612 10,236\nTotal off-balance sheet notional amounts 4 \u2014 4\nMaximum exposure to loss 628 9,612 10,240\nTotal assets of the entity 4,722 22,916 27,638\nAs at 31 December 2023\nFinancial assets at fair value through the income statement 35 \u2014 35\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nLoans and advances at amortised cost 154 \u2014 154\nDebt securities at amortised cost \u2014 9,270 9,270\nOther assets \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nTotal on-balance sheet exposures 189 9,270 9,459\nTotal off-balance sheet notional amounts 19 \u2014 19\nMaximum exposure to loss 208 9,270 9,478\nTotal assets of the entity 4,882 24,008 28,890\nNote\n1 None of the structured entities are Barclays Bank UK Group owned and not consolidated per IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.", "page_start": 232, "page_end": 233, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Exposure to loss is mitigated through collateral,\nfinancial guarantees, the availability of netting and credit protection held.\nLending\nThe portfolio includes lending provided by the Barclays Bank UK Group to unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of its\nlending business to earn income in the form of interest and lending fees and includes loans to structured entities that are generally\ncollateralised by property, equipment or other assets. All loans are subject to the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s credit sanctioning process.\nCollateral arrangements are specific to the circumstances of each loan with additional guarantees and collateral sought from the sponsor\nof the structured entity for certain arrangements.

As at 31 December\n2024, no assets were transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities.\n31 Securitisations\nAccounting for securitisations\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. Such transactions generally result\nin the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.\nSecuritisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the\nrecognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction; lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the\nBarclays Bank UK Group\u2019s continuing involvement in those assets or lead to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as\nassets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer. Full derecognition only occurs when the Barclays\nBank UK group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to\nreceive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or\nreinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest\nrate risk.\nIn the course of its normal banking activities, the Barclays Bank UK Group makes transfers of financial assets, either where legal rights to\nthe cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficially, where the Barclays Bank UK Group retains the rights to the\ncash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty. Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in\nderecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.\nA summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below:\nTransfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition\nThe Barclays Bank UK Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its credit card balances and mortgage loans. In these\ntransactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special\npurpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third party investors.\nSecuritisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition\nof the debt securities issued in the transaction. Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s\ncontinuing involvement in those assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of\nany rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.\nThe following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the\nassociated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet:", "page_start": 233, "page_end": 234, "company": "Barclays", "ticker": "BARC", "sector": "banking", "country": "UK", "report_type": "annual_report", "fiscal_year": 2024, "source_url": "https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports/2024/Barclays-Bank-UK-Annual-Report-2024.pdf", "raw_pdf_path": "data/raw/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.pdf", "extracted_text_path": "data/processed/text/annual_reports/Barclays/2024/Barclays_2024_annual_report.txt", "document_id": "Barclays_2024_annual_report"}

Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these\nstructures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.\nThe table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement:\nContinuing involvement1 Gain/(loss) from continuing\ninvolvement\nMaximum For the year Cumulative to 31\nCarrying amount Fair value exposure to loss ended December\nType of transfer \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m\n2024\nResidential mortgage backed securities 941 934 941 34 24\nTotal 941 934 941 34 24\n2023\nResidential mortgage backed securities 600 600 600 (10) (10)\nTotal 600 600 600 (10) (10)\nNote\n1 Assets which represent the Barclays Bank UK Group\u2019s continuing involvement in derecognised assets are recorded in Loans and advances at amortised cost.\nNotes to the financial statements\nScope of consolidation\n32 Assets pledged, collateral received and assets transferred\nAssets are pledged or transferred as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending\nagreements or as security deposits relating to derivatives. Assets transferred are non-cash assets transferred to a third party that do not\nqualify for derecognition from the Barclays Bank UK Group balance sheet, for example because Barclays Bank UK Group retains\nsubstantially all the exposure to those assets under an agreement to repurchase them in the future for a fixed price.\nWhere non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral for cash received, the asset continues to be recognised in full, and a related\nliability is also recognised on the balance sheet. Where non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral in an exchange for non-cash\nassets, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full, and there is no associated liability as the non-cash collateral received is not\nrecognised on the balance sheet. The Barclays Bank UK Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the\ntransaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these pledged assets. Unless stated, the counterparty's recourse is\nnot limited to the transferred assets.\nCollateralised transactions, such as securities lending and borrowing, repurchase and derivative transactions are conducted in accordance\nwith standard terms which are customary in the market.\nThe following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security:\nBarclays Bank UK Group and PLC\n2024 2023\n\u00a3m \u00a3m\nLoans and advances at amortised cost 23,524 25,704\nCash collateral 3,972 3,650\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 1,761 1,264\nAssets pledged 29,257 30,618\nThe following table summarises the transferred financial assets and the associated liabilities.

The acquirer discloses information that enables users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the acquisition.\nOn 1 November 2024, Barclays Bank UK PLC completed the acquisition of Tesco Bank. The acquired business includes credit cards,\nunsecured personal loans, deposits and the operating infrastructure (Retail Bank Assets and Liabilities), along with the transfer of c.2,600\nemployees. The acquisition also includes assets, liabilities, and responsibilities related to a credit card securitisation originated under the\nTesco Bank brand. The acquisition of Tesco Bank by Barclays Bank UK PLC did not involve the acquisition of any equity interests.\nIn addition to the business acquisition, Barclays Bank UK has entered into a long-term, exclusive strategic partnership with Tesco Stores\nLimited for an initial period of 10 years to market and distribute credit cards, unsecured personal loans and deposits using the Tesco PLC\n(\u201cTesco\u201d) brand, as well as explore other opportunities to offer financial services to Tesco customers. Partnering with Tesco, the UK's\nlargest retailer which also operates the UK's largest loyalty scheme, represents a key opportunity to further our UK retail banking strategic\nambitions. The acquired customer base complements Barclays Bank UK's current business, as well as building on its existing UK strategic\npartnerships with other leading retail, consumer electronics and loyalty programme brands. As costs are incurred under this partnership\nagreement, these are accounted for in line with Barclays Bank UK group\u2019s relevant accounting policy for such costs.\nThe acquisition consisted of \u00a34,051m of gross credit card receivables, \u00a34,034m of gross unsecured personal loans, \u00a36,923m of customer\ndeposits and certain other assets and liabilities for total consideration of \u00a3616m in cash.

This excludes the gain recognised on acquisition of \u00a3558m and expected credit loss allowance of \u00a3209m\nrecognised subsequently along with the associated impairment expense on credit cards receivables and unsecured loan receivables.\nHad the retail banking business of Tesco Bank been acquired from 1 January 2024, additional income of \u00a3420m and profit before tax of\n\u00a3118m would have been recognised.
