Additional Information
Non-GAAP measures reconciliations
These non-GAAP measures, also known as alternative performance measures, are financial measures other than those defined in International
Financial Reporting Standards, that Shell considers provide useful information.
Earnings on a current cost of supplies basis
Segment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings), which is the earnings measure used by the Chief Executive
Officer for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. On this basis, the purchase price of volumes
sold during the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings
therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. The current cost of supplies adjustment does not impact
cash flow from operating activities in the "Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows". For "Reconciliation of CCS earnings to income for the period",
please refer to Note 7 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements".
Adjusted Earnings per share
Adjusted Earnings per share is calculated as Adjusted Earnings (see below) divided by the weighted average number of shares used as the basis
for basic earnings per share (see Note 31 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). Adjusted Earnings per share were 3.76 in 2024 (2024
Adjusted Earnings: $23,716 million; 2024 weighted average number of shares 6,299.6 million) and $4.20 in 2023 (2023 Adjusted Earnings
$28,250 million; 2023 weighted average number of shares: 6,733.5 million).
Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), and Cash flow
from operating activities
The "Adjusted Earnings" measure is presented on a CCS basis and aims to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell's financial performance
from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items
adjusted for current cost of supplies. These items are in some cases driven by external factors and may, either individually or collectively, hinder
the comparative understanding of Shell's financial results from period to period.
The "Adjusted EBITDA" measure is presented on a CCS basis and is used by management to evaluate Shell's performance in the period and
over time. We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as "Income/(loss) for the period" adjusted for current cost of supplies; identified items; tax charge/
(credit); depreciation, amortisation and depletion; exploration well write-offs; and net interest expense. All items include the non-controlling
interest component.

Shareholder distribution is used to evaluate the level of cash

paid to Shell plc shareholders and Repurchases of shares. Both are
reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Shareholder distribution as a percentage of CFFO is used to measure
the company's progress on increasing returns to shareholders. This
measure is calculated by dividing the Shareholder distribution
by the annual CFFO as presented in the Consolidated Statement
