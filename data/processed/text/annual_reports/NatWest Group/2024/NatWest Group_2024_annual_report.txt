NatWest Group total emissions and emissions estimates
During 2024, we continued to focus on activities with the potential to contribute towards our ambition to reduce emissions from our own operations as well as the estimated
emissions associated with our funding and financing activities. For our own operational emissions we achieved a 60% reduction against a 2019 baseline in our Scope 1 and location-
based Scope 2 emissions and a 44% reduction in Scope 3 operational emissions categories relevant to NatWest Group. The decrease in Scope 3 category 15 estimated financed emissions
between 2022 and 2023 reflects efforts to support customer transition, complemented with better availability of customer data. Own operational emissions and estimated absolute financed
emissions included in the table have been estimated based on the methodologies outlined in the NatWest Group 2024 Sustainability Basis of Reporting. Data availability and emissions
estimate methodologies continue to evolve. As a result, variations in estimated emissions may not always reflect changes in customer activity. Our estimation work has been guided by the
availability of methodologies for estimating financed emissions, most notably from the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).

2019, financed emissions were estimated for specific sectors as this was the first year of emissions estimation and capabilities were under development. We have continued to develop capabilities for estimating total customer Scope 1 and Scope 2 financed emissions, and
these were published from December 2022 onwards, hence 2019 is marked as NF.

(1) A syndicated loan transaction is defined by the PCAF standard as a loan made available by two or more providers under a common loan agreement and ranking credit is assigned upon signature of the loan documentation. Where a financial institution provides
an underwriting facility that puts the institution’s capital at risk, this should be treated separately from the role they provide in arranging and facilitating an issuance.
(2) The syndicated loan market is a private market with no requirement for banks to report collectively into third-party league tables. Based upon its own market knowledge, NatWest Group identified relevant loan markets volumes based upon an internal scope and
methodology with an aim to align to guidance from PCAF issued in December 2024. Numbers reported are therefore presented on a best-endeavours basis and are subject to change as guidance develops.
(3) In 2024, scope for the estimation of facilitated emissions was expanded to include syndicated lending, financial institutions and co-managers. Reporting of facilitated emissions in 2024 uses a 33% weighting factor. In 2023, the estimation of facilitated emissions
included corporate bond underwriting only. Estimated facilitated emissions, reported at 100% weighting, were 1.5 MtCO2e (equating to 0.5 MtCO2e if a 33% weighting factor had been used).

Emissions methodology and basis of preparation
Boundary: this statement has been prepared in accordance with our regulatory obligation to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pursuant to the Companies (Directors’ Report) and
Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018 which implement the UK Government’s policy on SECR. Our reporting year runs from 1 October 2023 to
30 September 2024. The emissions reporting boundary is defined as all entities and facilities either owned or under our operational control.
Reporting(6)(7): emissions have been reported using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and associated guidance and include all greenhouse gases, reported in tonnes of
carbon dioxide equivalent (COe) and global warming potential values. When converting data to carbon emissions, we use Emission Factors from UK Government Emissions Conversion

local authorities as required. NatWest Group uses a third-party software system, to capture and record our environmental impact and ensure that control framework and assurance
requirements are met. All data is aggregated at a regional level to reflect the total regional consumption. The regional consumption results are then collated to reflect the total NatWest
Group footprint. COe values are attributed to these sources via an automatic conversion module in the third-party system.

For more information, refer to the own operational footprint page at www.natwestgroup.com.
(1) Offshore area as defined in The Companies (Directors Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon) Regulations 2018. This includes Jersey and Guernsey but not our overseas sites in America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. These are included in the
global total (excluding UK and offshore).
(2) Scope 1 emissions from natural gas, liquid fossil fuels, fluorinated gas losses and owned/leased vehicles.
(3) Scope 2 emissions from electricity, district heating and cooling used in NatWest Group premises.
(4) We have procured 100% electricity from renewable sources globally using green tariffs and renewable electricity certificates. The remaining Scope 2 market-based emissions arise from district cooling, district heating and the residual amount of
non-renewable electricity.
(5) Scope 3 emissions sources for our own operational emissions cover categories 1–14, with our direct own operations covering only paper, water, and categories 5–7. For more information, refer to page 23 of the NatWest Group 2024 Sustainability Report.
(6) Low data accuracy is a key risk of our reporting, as this could lead to misreporting of own operations emissions figures. To combat this, we have robust internal controls processes, with data and claims subject to third-party assurance.
(7) The historic values reported in the table above may be updated from values we reported in 2023. This is due to updated bills, data provision and extrapolations. Further, future data is subject to change following any significant change to our business size
and scope, as baseline recalculation may result in differing emissions reductions.

Risk overview continued
Risk directory and principal risks
To ensure common language and a consistent approach across NatWest Group, the risk directory defines and documents all principal risks that NatWest Group may face, categorised into
financial and non-financial. The risk directory is an important component of the EWRMF, underpinning the linkage between strategy, risk appetite, risk reporting and governance. Principal
risks are the Board-approved EWRMF categories that describe the highest-level financial and non-financial risks in the risk directory. All principal risks are overseen by the ERC and BRC,
with performance against risk appetite reported at every meeting and spotlights on each risk considered at least annually.

Top and emerging risks
Top and emerging risks are future scenarios that could have a significantly negative impact on our ability to operate, or deliver, our strategy and are managed through the EWRMF toolkit.
They usually combine elements of several principal risks and require a coordinated management response. Top risks could occur or require management action within two years, while
emerging risks are evolving and/or could occur over a longer time horizon but have the potential to become a top risk. In 2024, the ERC, the BRC and the Board received regular reporting
on top and emerging risks. The BRC also engaged in focused horizon scanning sessions in 2024, to enable early identification and mitigation of top and emerging risks.

A tax charge of £1,465 million for the year ended 31 December 2024 arises rather than
higher than 2023 primarily due to a lower impairment charge partially offset by higher
the expected charge of £1,549 million based on the UK corporation tax rate of 25%. The
costs largely attributable to inflationary pressures.
lower tax charge primarily reflects tax credits for the re-recognition of previously
impaired deferred tax assets on brought forward tax losses in the UK and the
Netherlands. These have been partially offset by the UK banking surcharge and various
other non-tax deductible expenses. Refer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements for further details.

Board effectiveness review
In accordance with the Code, an evaluation of the performance of the Board, its committees, the Chair and individual directors usually
takes place annually. The evaluation is externally facilitated every three years, with internal evaluations in the intervening years.
In 2023 the Board decided to defer the internal evaluation of Board and committee effectiveness due in Q4 2023 until 2024, given the July 2023 change in Group CEO and upcoming
Chair succession. The most recent external evaluation was conducted in 2021, and therefore the 2024 process was due to be conducted externally in accordance with the three-year

The directors’ remuneration policy (the Policy)
Subject to approval from shareholders, the new Policy set out below will be effective from the date of the 2025 NatWest Group plc AGM. It will apply for a period of three years, until the
date of the 2028 NatWest Group plc AGM, unless a revised Policy is approved by shareholders before then. The Policy is also available under the Governance section of natwestgroup.com,
along with the full terms of reference of the Group Performance and Remuneration Committee.
References contained within this Policy and its operation are on the basis of current regulatory requirements at the time of publication. Following the publication in November 2024 of
the PRA’s outstanding consultation paper CP16/24 – ‘Remuneration reform’, setting out proposed changes to the remuneration regulations for PRA regulated firms – it is foreseen that
a number of changes to the regulatory requirements will be made which will take effect following the start of the Policy. There is flexibility within the operation of the Policy to adapt to
any changes to the regulatory requirements and the committee will disclose its planned implementation of the Policy after the final regulations are known.

Procedures are in place to help enforce the shareholding requirements, both during and
after employment. Executive directors are required to agree to be bound by the terms of the
requirements and to use prescribed nominee accounts to hold shares subject to restrictions.
In order that executive directors can engage in structured, regular share dealing activity,
the bank may offer them an annual opportunity to enter into a trading plan in respect of
those vested shares which are free from retention requirements. Such trading plans allow
executive directors to sell such shares via a broker, on a non-discretionary basis, to assist
with cash flow and diversification of their portfolio. Executive directors would only be able
to enter into a trading plan with regard to any 25% shares they hold at the date they enter

Other policy elements for directors
Provisions Operation
Recruitment Our boardroom inclusion policy is in place to ensure that NatWest Group can attract, motivate and retain the best talent and avoid limiting potential caused by bias,
policy prejudice or discrimination. When recruiting new executive directors, the Policy aims to be competitive and to structure pay in line with the framework applicable to
current directors (as stated in the tables above), while recognising that adjustment to quantum may be necessary to secure the preferred candidate.
A buyout policy exists to replace awards forfeited or payments forgone, which is in line with regulatory requirements. The committee will minimise buyouts wherever
possible and ensure they are no more generous than, and on similar terms to, the original awards or payments they are replacing.
No sign-on awards will be offered on joining.
Any awards granted following recruitment may be made under such NatWest Group employee share plans as are in place from time to time or otherwise
in accordance with the relevant provisions in the Listing Rules.
Notice and Executive directors
termination provisions Executive directors’ contracts are typically permanent and there is no fixed duration, and, as set out in our executive directors’ service agreements, each party is
required to give 12 months’ notice to the other party to terminate the employment. The committee will ensure that any proposals relating to termination payments
recognise that failure is not rewarded. There are no pre-determined provisions for compensation on termination. There is discretion for NatWest Group to make a
payment in lieu of notice (based on salary only) which is released in monthly instalments. The executive director must take all reasonable steps to find alternative
work and any remaining instalments will be reduced as appropriate to offset income from any such work.
Chair and non-executive directors
Instead of service contracts, the Chair and the non-executive directors have letters of appointment that reflect their responsibilities and time commitments. There are
no notice periods and we will pay no compensation in the event of termination, other than standard payments for the period served up to the termination date.
Under the Board appointment policy, non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
At the end of this initial term, a further three-year term may be agreed. Non-executive directors may be invited to serve beyond six years, typically up to a maximum
tenure of nine years. In the event of any non-executive directors being invited to extend their tenure beyond nine years, the rationale for any such extension would
be explained in NatWest Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year in question. The Chair is not subject to the Board appointment policy but is subject to
the UK Corporate Governance Code’s requirements relating to the maximum nine-year tenure period for chairs.
All directors stand for annual election or re-election by shareholders at the NatWest Group plc AGM. All director appointment dates are detailed in the Our Board
section of the Corporate governance report.

awards on termination Malus and clawback provisions will continue to apply to all leavers and could be used to adjust awards if subsequent issues relating to executive directors’
performance become known.
In the event of a change of control, outstanding awards will be treated in line with the provisions of the relevant plan rules, as approved by shareholders.
Fixed share allowances
Accrued fixed share allowance shares will continue to be released over the applicable retention period helping to ensure that former executive directors maintain
an appropriate interest in shares. In all leaver circumstances, executive directors will continue to be eligible to receive a pro-rated fixed share allowance to reflect
the period up to and including the termination date.
Annual bonus awards
Bonus awards will not usually be made in the final year of employment unless the termination is for one of the specified ‘good leaver’ reasons, in which case a bonus
may be payable on a pro-rata basis for the year in which an executive director leaves. Bonus awards will remain subject to the achievement of the performance
measures assessed at the year end. Bonuses would continue to be paid in cash and shares.
Any deferred bonus awards that are unvested will normally lapse on leaving unless good leaver circumstances apply, in which case the awards will normally continue
to vest on the original vesting dates.
PSP and RSP awards
Unvested PSP and RSP awards normally lapse in full on leaving unless the termination is for one of the specified ‘good leaver’ reasons. Unvested PSP and RSP
awards held by good leavers will normally vest on the original vesting dates, subject to the applicable performance conditions being met and the rules of the relevant
plan, including pro-rating for time served (unless the committee exercises discretion to disapply such pro-rating).
Individuals under notice will not be eligible to be considered for a PSP award in respect of the final year of employment, even if they are considered good leavers.
No further RSP awards will be granted to executive directors following the approval of the Policy by shareholders at the 2025 NatWest Group plc AGM.
Contractual provisions Executive director service agreements include standard clauses covering remuneration arrangements and discretionary incentive plans (as set out in this report).
The agreements also reference: reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses; annual leave; redundancy terms and sickness absence; the performance
review process; directors’ and officers’ insurance; the disciplinary procedure; and potential for dismissal in the event of personal underperformance or breaches
of NatWest Group’s policies.
The committee retains the discretion to make payments (including but not limited to professional and outplacement fees) to: facilitate smooth handovers;
mitigate against legal claims; and/or procure reasonable assistance with investigations or claims.

– For our wider workforce, the annual bonus pool is based on performance against a balanced scorecard of strategically
important measures: financial performance; customer outcomes; people, culture and diversity; risk management; risk events
and progress against our climate and purpose ambitions, broadly aligning with the position for the executive directors and
the executive management team.
– Sharing in Success provides a further way for sustainable performance to be reflected in pay decisions throughout the
organisation. For 2024, we measured success based on being brilliant for our customers, underpinned by financial
performance, our approach to risk and delivering value for shareholders.
Details of performance against the 2024 targets for executive directors can be found later in this report. More information on our sustainability priorities can be
found in the NatWest Group plc 2024 Sustainability Report, available at natwestgroup.com.

The directors’ remuneration policy and wider workforce remuneration continued
Wider workforce remuneration
We have invested significantly in colleague(1) pay over the last few years, focusing on rewarding colleagues in a fair, sustainable and transparent way. The remuneration policy for our
wider workforce supports a culture where individuals are rewarded for sustained performance and demonstrating the right behaviours. The same principles apply to everyone, adjusted
to comply with local requirements. The principles are designed to support a performance culture, be market facing and ensure compliance and governance.

Pay for executive directors is aligned with the wider workforce, with two main differences: (i) the use of long-term incentive awards; and (ii) a requirement to maintain a holding of shares
in NatWest Group, both during and after employment. These differences are deliberate and recognise that it is in the best interests of our stakeholders for executive directors to have a
significant proportion of their remuneration paid in shares and subject to long-term shareholding requirements.
(1) Colleagues mean all permanent employees and, in some instances, members of the wider workforce e.g. temporary employees and agency workers.

Total remuneration 4,936 1,706 4,520 2,944
(1) Fixed share allowance: The fixed share allowance is based on 100% of salary and, as part of fixed remuneration, is not subject to any performance conditions.
(2) Benefits: Includes standard benefit funding at £26,250 per annum. For Mr Thwaite this includes travel assistance in connection with company business (£63,154) and assistance with home security (£2,924). For Ms Murray it includes travel assistance
in connection with company business (£12,824) and assistance with home security (£2,924).
(3) Pension: Executive directors receive a monthly pension allowance of 10% of base salary and can choose to participate in the company’s pension arrangements. Mr Thwaite stopped being a member of the defined benefit pension scheme on
28 February 2024. The value of the defined benefit pension for Mr Thwaite from 1 January to 28 February 2024 is based on the capitalised pension accrual (net of CPI inflation) during the period less the direct employee contribution (£2,918).
Due to Mr Thwaite’s pensionable salary not increasing over this period and the CPI inflation figure required to be used in the calculation, the outcome of this calculation was negative £78,280. As the aggregate value of these elements is negative,
in line with regulations, the amount included in the single figure for 1 January to 28 February 2024 is zero. Full details of the defined benefit pension scheme can be found in the 2023 Directors’ remuneration report.
(4) Annual bonus: In determining bonus awards for 2024, the committee assessed performance against financial, strategic and personal measures as set out below and on the next page.
(5) Long-term incentive: The 2024 value relates to LTI awards granted in 2022. The committee assessed performance prior to vesting and also considered whether the outcome could represent a windfall gain, as set out on pages 149 and 150.
(6) Other benefits: The 2024 value relates to the first Sharing in Success award delivered in NatWest Group shares in May 2024 to all colleagues (including executive directors). Awards of £1,000 per colleague were made in respect of 2023

Figures used in bonus scorecard 14.8% £14.2 £(7.7)
(1) For the purpose of assessment under the bonus scorecard, adjustments are made to the published RoTE to exclude material factors outside of management’s control. Items will only be adjusted if this results in an impact of at least 0.25% to the RoTE figure.
For performance year 2024, these include:
a. Material changes in base rate from that assumed at the beginning of the year;
b. Gains from interest and FX risk management derivatives not in accounting hedge relationships, own credit adjustments, and the timing of FX losses;
c. Deferred tax asset and effective tax rate changes;
d. Other income not driven by management actions; and
e. Increase in bank levies, costs in relation to retail share offering and strategic decision to exit Poland branch operations within operating costs.
(2) Similarly for income, the definition for the purpose of the scorecard excludes the material changes in base rate from that assumed at the beginning of the year as well as other income not driven by management actions.
(3) For operating expenses, the impact of increase in bank levies and costs in relation to retail share offering have been excluded in line with our external guidance; as well as excluding the impact of the strategic decision to exit Poland branch operations.
(4) Capital has been assessed on a qualitative basis against the range.
(5) Amounts quoted are pre tax whereas RoTE impacts are post tax.
(6) Targets: Volume of customer engagement through carbon tracking, energy and retrofit journey tools; Number of large customers for which the Customer Transition Plan Assessment (CTPA) is undertaken; and % of in-scope AUM which align to a net zero
trajectory. Achieved: Volume of customer engagement through carbon tracking, energy and retrofit journey tools achieved with the following two targets exceeded: 2024 achievement of 573 CTPA assessments undertaken versus a target of 100; and
achievement of 58% of in-scope AUM versus a target of 40%. Full details on climate metrics can be found in the NatWest Group plc 2024 Sustainability Report.
(7) As NPS is not available for NatWest Markets, an internal CTR is applied to assess NatWest Markets’ customer performance. The aggregated view reflects the contribution of each franchise to NatWest Group’s income. Targets: Consumers: Maintain NatWest

across these eight targets mean that the Customer outcome is 4.72%.
(8) NatWest Group’s management structures were revised during 2024. For the purpose of remuneration reporting, the representation targets were set based on the management structures in place at the start of 2024, with performance assessed at
31 December 2024.

2022 LTI award – Pre-vest performance assessment framework
LTI awards were made in early 2022 following an assessment of performance over the 2021 financial year. Before vesting, the committee carries out a further review to consider whether
anything has come to light which might call the original award into question. Internal control functions, the Group Board Risk Committee (BRC) and Korn Ferry, as independent advisers,
support the committee in this assessment, with the outcome set out below.

Remuneration for the Chair and non-executive directors in 2024
The Chair’s composite fee was increased from £775,000 to £800,000 per annum and the basic Board fee was increased from £85,000 to £88,000 per annum from 1 May 2024.
The increases were made after considering the fees paid by other major UK banks as well as salary increases for the wider workforce. The increases of 3.23% and 3.53% respectively
were lower than the 4% average salary increase applied across our global workforce from April 2024. The Colleague Advisory Panel (CAP) Chair fee was unchanged at £15,000.
All changes were within the scope of the Policy approved by shareholders and no directors were involved in decisions involving their own remuneration. All other fee increases

Annual change in directors’ pay compared to average change in employee pay
Remuneration for employees is based on salary, benefits and annual bonus. Executive directors receive fixed share allowances and, from the 2022 performance year onwards, annual
bonus awards. The Chair and non-executive directors receive fees rather than salary and do not receive annual bonus awards. We regularly review membership of Board committees and
changes in membership will impact the level of fees paid to non-executive directors from one year to the next. The benefits figures for non-executive directors can also change significantly
year on year depending on the amount of travel undertaken in connection with Board meetings. The data for non-executive directors below reflects the value of benefits mainly falling in
2020 and 2021, due to less travel during the COVID-19 restrictions, before returning to more typical levels from 2022.

(1) Standard benefit funding for executive directors has remained unchanged. The figures above exclude any other benefits to executive directors such as travel assistance in connection with company business, the value of which is disclosed each year in the single
total figure table.
(2) NatWest Group plc is a holding company and is not an employing entity. The disclosure above compares the change in directors’ pay with all employees based in the UK. The data is based on the average full time equivalent salary and benefit costs of UK-based
employees of NatWest Group, excluding the CEO and the CFO. This is considered to be the most representative comparator group, as it covers the majority of employees and the CEO and CFO are based in the UK. The average percentage change relates to
salaries and benefits awarded in the respective financial years for UK employees and therefore may differ from figures quoted elsewhere in the report, for example, the proposed salary increases announced in December 2024 to be awarded from April 2025.
(3) Paul Thwaite was appointed as Group CEO on 25 July 2023, so there are no prior year comparisons. As he was an employee of NatWest Group before becoming Group CEO, the change in his remuneration is based on actual amounts he earned over the
whole of 2023, not just in his capacity as Group CEO.
(4) Howard Davies stepped down from the role of Chairman on 15 April 2024.
(5) Rick Haythornthwaite joined the Board of NatWest Group plc as an independent non-executive director on 8 January 2024 and following a handover period took over as Chair on 15 April 2024. Therefore, there are no prior year comparisons.
(6) Geeta Gopalan joined the Board on 1 July 2024, Stuart Lewis joined the Board on 1 April 2023, Roisin Donnelly joined the Board on 1 October 2022 and Yasmin Jetha re-joined the Board on 1 April 2020, so there are no prior year comparisons.

Supplementary information on the pay ratio table:
(1) The data for 2024 is based on remuneration earned by Mr Thwaite, as set out in the single total figure of remuneration table in the remuneration report.
(2) The employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles (lower, median and upper quartiles) were determined as at 31 December of the relevant year, based on full-time equivalent remuneration for all UK employees. This includes fixed pay (salary, pension funding
and where relevant benefit funding and other allowances) and also any variable pay (based on the amount to be paid). For employees who work part time, fixed pay is grossed up to the full-time equivalent.
(3) ‘Option A’ methodology was selected as this is considered the most statistically accurate method. UK employees receive a pension funding allowance set as a percentage of salary. Some employees continue to participate in the defined benefit pension scheme.
For simplicity and consistency with prior years, we have included the pension funding allowance value in the calculation for all employees.
(4) The data for the three employees identified has been considered and fairly reflects pay at the relevant quartiles among the UK employee population. Each of the three individuals was a full-time employee during the year and none received an exceptional award
that would otherwise inflate their pay figure.

Directors’ interests in NatWest Group plc shares (audited)
Under the shareholding requirements, the Group CEO and Group CFO need to build up and maintain shares to the value of 500% of salary and 300% of salary, respectively.
The requirements apply both during employment and for two years after leaving, in line with best practice. Procedures are in place including the submission of pre-approval requests

to becoming an executive director, with payments deferred in line with regulatory requirements. Similarly, for Ms Murray the deferred award from 2019 relates to annual bonus awards granted for performance prior to becoming an executive director.

Overseeing the MRT identification process.
Receiving accountability review updates and approving accountability decisions for the population within its governance.
The committee also approves submissions made throughout the year to the UK regulators outside the formal meetings, as required.
Membership Details of members and attendance is on page 126.
Effectiveness review In accordance with the Code, an evaluation of the performance of the Board and its committees, including Group RemCo, was conducted by an external
facilitator in 2024. Further information on the review can be found on pages 103 to 105.
Role of the committee To mitigate potential conflicts of interest, no individuals are involved in decisions regarding their own remuneration. The Group Chief Operating Officer, who is
responsible for the People function and executive compensation, may be present to support the committee when discussions take place on senior executive
pay, but she is never present for discussions on her own remuneration. It is the committee, rather than management, that appoints the remuneration advisers.
Committee advisers Korn Ferry (KF) were appointed by the committee as remuneration adviser to the committee in March 2024 following a period of transition from our previous
adviser PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). Details of PwC’s appointment can be found in the 2023 Directors’ remuneration report. KF provide executive/
professional search services alongside HR advisory services including assessment services and organisational strategy services to NatWest Group subsidiaries.
PwC provide professional services including assurance, advisory, tax and legal advice to NatWest Group subsidiaries. PwC and KF are signatories to the
voluntary code of conduct in relation to remuneration consulting in the UK. The committee is satisfied the advice received is independent and objective. There
are no connections between PwC, KF and individual directors to be disclosed. Fees paid to PwC and KF for advising the committee are based primarily on a
fixed fee structure with any additional items charged on a time/cost basis. Fees for 2024 in relation to directors’ remuneration for PwC amounted to £107,562
for January and February 2024, before they ceased to formally advise the committee (2023 – £211,506), and £290,000 for KF (2023 – £19,000) excluding VAT.
The committee also took account of the views of the Group Chair, the Group CEO, the Group CFO, the Group Chief Operating Officer, the Director of Reward
& Employment, the Group Chief Risk Officer, the Group Chief Audit Executive and other support and control functions. The committee also received input from
the BRC, the GAC and the Performance and Remuneration Committees for the principal legal entities across NatWest Group. In addition, the committee
received external legal advice from Clifford Chance on a small number of matters in 2024.

(1) The table shows gross loans only and excludes amounts that were outside the scope of the ECL framework. Other financial assets within the scope of the IFRS 9 ECL framework were cash and balances at central banks totalling £91.8 billion (2023 –
£103.1 billion) and debt securities of £62.4 billion (2023 – £50.1 billion).
For the notes to this table refer to the following page. (2) Includes loans to customers and banks.
(3) Includes £4 million (2023 – £9 million) related to assets classified as FVOCI and £0.1 billion (2023 – £0.1 billion) related to off-balance sheet exposures.
(4) ECL provisions coverage is calculated as ECL provisions divided by loans – amortised cost and FVOCI. It is calculated on loans and total ECL provisions, including ECL for other (non-loan) assets and unutilised exposure. Some segments with a high
proportion of debt securities or unutilised exposure may result in a not meaningful coverage ratio.
(5) Includes a £12 million release (2023 – £16 million releasee) related to other financial assets, of which £4 million release (2023 – £6 million charge) related to assets classified as FVOCI and includes a £5 million release (2023 – £9 million release) related to
contingent liabilities.

(1) Includes cash and securities collateral.
(2) Includes guarantees, charges over trade debtors, other asset finance related physical collateral as well as the amount by which credit risk exposure is reduced through netting arrangements, mainly cash management pooling, which give NatWest Group a
legal right to set off the financial asset against a financial liability due to the same counterparty. Any additional credit risk mitigation from a synthetic securitization is not included in the table above.
(3) NatWest Group holds collateral in respect of individual loans – amortised cost to banks and customers. This collateral includes mortgages over property (both personal and commercial); charges over business assets such as plant and equipment;
inventories and trade debtors; and guarantees of lending from parties other than the borrower. NatWest Group obtains collateral in the form of securities in reverse repurchase agreements. Collateral values are capped at the value of the loan.
(4) Stage 3 mortgage exposures have relatively limited uncovered exposure reflecting the security held. On unsecured credit cards and other personal borrowing, the residual uncovered amount reflects historical experience of continued cash recovery post
default through ongoing engagement with customers.
(5) Stage 3 exposures post credit risk enhancement and mitigation in Non-personal mainly represent enterprise value and the impact of written down collateral values; an individual assessment to determine ECL will consider multiple scenarios and in some
instances allocate a probability weighting to a collateral value in excess of the written down value.

(2) As at 31 December 2024, £12.6 billion, 98.0%, of the private banking mortgage portfolio had flood risk data available (2023 – £13.0 billion, 98.1%). Of which, 5.4% were rated as high flood risk and 1.0% as very high flood risk (2023 – 5.74% high flood risk
and 1.1% very high flood risk). 63% of the exposure is in the Greater London region.
(3) Flood risk is modelled by calculating an estimated loss for each flood source different types of flooding (fluvial, pluvial, tidal), annualised for each source and combined for a total flood score. Flood defences were considered where available. Flood scores
were allocated per property based on the potential annualised loss (£) to a property dependent on the type, frequency and depth of flooding modelled across different return periods. The scoring ranged from 0 to 100, with 0 being lowest and 100 being
the highest risk. A score of 61 and above was considered to be high risk and properties with a score of 81 and above were considered to be very high risk after flood mitigants were taken-into-account.

 The majority of the CRE portfolio was located and managed in the UK. Business appetite and strategy was aligned across NatWest Group. Lending appetite is subject to regular
review.
 While the real estate investment market was subdued through much of 2024, the portfolio remained resilient and there was moderate growth.
 Credit quality remained stable with very limited instances of specific cases deteriorating. Challenges persist in parts of the office sub-sector, but NatWest Group remains
comfortable with exposures held in this sub-sector, representing approximately 16% of the overall CRE book.

 ECL coverage for mortgages remained stable overall during 2024, with growth in Stage 3 ECL partly offset by a reduction in good book ECL, primarily driven by the reduction in
economic uncertainty post model adjustment levels. PDs remained broadly flat with the effect of the modest increase in arrears levels being offset by the impact of improved
economics since 2023 and stable portfolio performance overall.
 The decrease in Stage 1 ECL was also driven by the cost of living post model adjustment reduction. Refer to the Governance and post model adjustments section for further
details.
 The Stage 3 inflows remained broadly stable, albeit with signs of an upward drift in default rates, reflecting slightly poorer arrears performance on mortgages recently rolled-off
onto higher product rates. The increase in Stage 3 ECL primarily reflected increases in ECL for post-default interest.
 There were net flows into Stage 2 from Stage 1 in line with a modest upward trend in arrears.
 The relatively small ECL cost for net re-measurement on transfer into Stage 3 included the effect of risk targeted ECL adjustments, when previously in the good book. Refer to the
Governance and post model adjustments section for further details.
 Write-off occurs once the repossessed property has been sold and there is a residual shortfall balance remaining outstanding. This would typically be within five years from default
but can be longer.

 Total ECL decreased, mainly in Stage 3, due to the reduction of balances from debt sale activity on Personal unsecured portfolios.
 Stable portfolio performance was observed during the year. PD modelling updates coupled with LGD modelling updates were reflected in the performing book ECL, with coverage

 Flow rates into Stage 3 reduced for the year, in line with broader portfolio performance.
 Unsecured retail performing balances grew steadily in 2024, largely in line with industry trends.
 Write-off occurs once recovery activity with the customer has been concluded or there are no further recoveries expected, but no later than six years after default.

PD modelling updates coupled with LGD modelling updates were reflected in the performing book ECL, with coverage  Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL reduced, reflecting a combination of stable portfolio performance, reductions in post model adjustments and net improvements in economic scenarios.
levels showing a modest reduction since the prior period.  Stage 3 ECL increased due to a small number of large counterparties, but in total, the number of individual defaults remained low. Flows into Stage 3 were consistent with 2023
 Flow rates into Stage 3 reduced for the year, in line with broader portfolio performance. and considerably below historical trends.
 Unsecured retail performing balances grew steadily in 2024, largely in line with industry trends.  Write-offs levels continue to remain below historical trends.
 Write-off occurs once recovery activity with the customer has been concluded or there are no further recoveries expected, but no later than six years after default.  Overall, impairment charges were low, with Stage 3 individual charges offset by performing book releases.

For the notes to this table refer to the following page.
 The level of PD driven deterioration increased across the mortgage portfolio throughout 2024, reflecting modest increases in the early arrears level. However, the year end
economic scenarios update resulted in a reduction in PD levels and a further build up in PD persistence levels.
 Modelling updates in the unsecured portfolios at both Q1 and year end, resulted in reduced in-lifetime PDs, driving a segment of lower risk cases out of PD deterioration.
 Higher risk mortgage customers who utilised the new Mortgage Charter measures continue to be collectively migrated into Stage 2, approximately £0.9 billion of exposures, and
were captured in the collective SICR and other reasons category.
 Accounts that were less than 30 days past due continued to represent the vast majority of the Stage 2 population.

(1) Includes cases where a PD assessment cannot be made and accounts where the PD has deteriorated beyond a prescribed backstop threshold aligned to risk management practices.
(2) The table is prepared on a hierarchical basis from top to bottom, for example, accounts with PD deterioration may also trigger backstop(s) but are only reported under PD deterioration.
(3) Previously published sectors for the Non-personal portfolio have been re-presented to reflect internal sector reporting. Property is now included in corporate and other.
 PD deterioration continued to be the primary trigger of migration of exposures from Stage 1 into Stage 2. There was an increase in cases triggering PD deterioration partially due
to additional sectors included in economic uncertainty post model adjustments.
 Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss remained an important backstop indicator of a SICR. The exposures captured by Heighted Monitoring or Risk of Credit Loss
decreased over the period, due to the increase in PD deterioration.
 PD persistence related to the SME Retail portfolio only, with reductions due to some stable portfolio performance and net improvements in economic scenarios and weightings.

(1) Retail Banking excludes a non-material amount of lending held on relatively small legacy portfolios.

(1) Includes cases where a PD assessment cannot be made and accounts where the PD has deteriorated beyond a prescribed backstop threshold aligned to risk management practices.
(2) The table is prepared on a hierarchical basis from top to bottom, for example, accounts with PD deterioration may also trigger backstop(s) but are only reported under PD deterioration.
(3) Previously published sectors for the Non-personal portfolio have been re-presented to reflect internal sector reporting. Property is now included in corporate and other.
 PD deterioration continued to be the primary trigger of migration of exposures from Stage 1 into Stage 2. There was an increase in cases triggering PD deterioration partially due
to additional sectors included in economic uncertainty post model adjustments.
 Heightened Monitoring and Risk of Credit Loss remained an important backstop indicator of a SICR. The exposures captured by Heighted Monitoring or Risk of Credit Loss
decreased over the period, due to the increase in PD deterioration.
 PD persistence related to the SME Retail portfolio only, with reductions due to some stable portfolio performance and net improvements in economic scenarios and weightings.

The contractual maturity of loans to customers and customer deposits are shown below. The table demonstrates the maturity transformation role being performed by NatWest Group
of lending long-term whilst relying largely on short-term funding. This is possible as the behavioural profiles of many customer deposits, which tend to be repayable on demand, show
longer maturity and greater stability than their contractual agreements.
NatWest Group forms expectations on customer behaviours through both qualitative and quantitative techniques, incorporating observed customer behaviours over historic time
periods, which includes the more recent periods of interest rate change. Customer behaviour assumptions are approved by the NatWest Group Balance Sheet Committee and have
been used to prepare the funding gap analysis, which reduces maturity mismatch across the periods shown.

 The net customer funding surplus increased by £1 billion during 2024 to £69 billion driven by a £11 billion increase in deposits and a £10 billion increase in loans to customers.
 The customer deposit mix was broadly similar to 2023, with additional prudence applied to customer account depositor behavioural assumptions.
EEnnccuummbbrraannccee ((aauuddiitteedd))
NatWest Group evaluates the extent to which assets can be financed in a secured form (encumbrance), but certain asset types lend themselves more readily to encumbrance. The
typical characteristics that support encumbrance are an ability to pledge those assets to another counterparty or entity through operation of law without necessarily requiring prior
notification, homogeneity, predictable and measurable cash flows, and a consistent and uniform underwriting and collection process. Retail assets including residential mortgages,
credit card receivables and personal loans display many of these features.
NatWest Group categorises its assets into four broad groups, those that are:
 Already encumbered and used to support funding currently in place through own-asset securitisations, covered bonds and securities repurchase agreements.
 Pre-positioned with central banks as part of funding schemes and those encumbered under such schemes.
 Ring-fenced to meet regulatory requirements, where NatWest Group has in place an operational continuity in resolution (OCIR) investment mandate wherein the PRA requires
critical service providers to hold segregated liquidity buffers covering at least 50% of their annual fixed overheads.
 Unencumbered. In this category, NatWest Group has in place an enablement programme which seeks to identify assets capable of being encumbered and to identify the actions to
facilitate such encumbrance whilst not affecting customer relationships or servicing. Programmes to manage the use of assets to actively support funding are established within UK
DoLSub and NatWest Markets Plc.

Sensitivity of fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) portfolios and cash flow hedging reserves to interest rate movements
NatWest Group holds most of the bonds in its liquidity portfolio at fair value and the bonds are generally classified as FVOCI for accounting purposes. Valuation changes arising from
unexpected movements in market rates are initially recognised in FVOCI reserves.
Interest rate swaps are used to implement the structural hedging programme and also hedging of some personal and commercial lending portfolios, primarily fixed-rate mortgages.
Generally, these swaps are booked in cash flow hedge accounting relationships. Changes in the valuation of swaps that are in effective cash flow hedge accounting relationships are
recognised in cash flow hedge reserves.
The table below shows the sensitivity of bonds initially classified as FVOCI and swaps subject to cash flow hedge accounting to a parallel shift in all rates. Valuation changes affecting
interest rate swaps that hedge bonds in the liquidity portfolio are also included. Where FVOCI bonds and swaps are booked in fair value hedge accounting relationships, the valuation
change affecting both instruments would be recognised in the income statement. Cash flow hedges are assumed to be fully effective.
The effectiveness of cash flow and fair value hedge relationships is monitored and regularly tested in accordance with IFRS requirements. Note also that valuation changes affecting
the cash flow hedge reserve affect tangible net asset value, but would not be expected to affect CET1 capital.

How we scoped our audit to respond to the risk and involvement with component teams
We performed centralised procedures and full scope audit procedures over this risk, which covered 99% of the risk amount. Specific scope audit procedures pertaining to the
RBSI component were undertaken by the component audit team, which covered 1% of the total risk amount. Total audit procedures covered 100% of the risk amount.
The majority of audit procedures were undertaken by the Group audit team for the components excluding RBSI, with component audit teams supporting and reporting on the
following audit procedures:
 Specific key data testing impacting the ECL calculation, and the credit risk disclosures;
 Procedures over the valuation of a sample of individual provisions for cases managed outside of central restructuring; and
− Procedures over the valuation of a sample of individual loans not identified as impaired.
The Group audit team’s involvement with the component teams and procedures performed included:
 Risk assessment procedures and determining the type and extent of work to be undertaken at each of the components;
 Regular interactions throughout the course of the audit, including planning meetings, maintaining regular communications on the status, and meetings on results and

Key observations communicated to the Group Audit Committee
Based on our testing procedures, including validating management’s remediation activities, and testing of compensating controls, we are satisfied that reliance can be placed upon IT
controls impacting material financial reporting systems. The following matters were reported to the Group Audit Committee:
 Overall, in combination with compensating controls, we are satisfied that the Group’s overall IT control environment appropriately supports the financial reporting process.
 While improvements have been made to further standardise IT access management processes and controls, there are still IT applications relevant to financial reporting
which make use of bespoke tools and/or processes to perform access-related controls. Control deficiencies continued to be observed in these areas, which led to an
increase in the overall number of reported IT control deficiencies requiring remediation by management.

Note 8 to the Parent Company financial statements
In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a key audit matter in relation to provisions for customer redress, litigation and other regulatory matters. We did not consider this to be a
key audit matter in the current year due to the resolution of several matters, reducing the assessed risk and audit effort. Further, we have refined one of the key audit matters in the
current year, to now exclude the recognition of deferred tax assets, due to the reduced sensitivity of the recognised asset to the underlying forecast and impairment of goodwill due to
the significant headroom associated.

2 Non-interest income
There are three main categories of non-interest income: net fees and commissions, trading income, and other operating income.
Net fees and commissions is the difference between fees received from customers for services provided by NatWest Group, such as credit card annual fees,

amendments from the relevant period judged as material, were reviewed. While uncertainties remain, the review indicated the risk of a change in the defined benefit obligation (DBO) was remote, so no adjustment was made to the DBO value. This
position is unchanged at year end.

The IAS 19 valuation uses a single discount rate set by reference to the yield on a basket of high quality sterling corporate bonds.
Significant judgement is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the basket of bonds that is used to determine the discount rate used in the IAS 19 valuations. The
criteria include issue size, quality of pricing and the exclusion of outliers. Judgement is also required in determining the shape of the yield curve at long durations; a constant credit
spread relative to gilts is assumed. Sensitivity to the main assumptions is presented below.
The weighted average duration of the Main section’s defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2024 is 13 years (2023 – 14.0 years). The chart below shows the projected benefit
payment pattern for the Main section in nominal terms. These cashflows are based on the most recent formal actuarial valuation, effective 31 December 2023.

The IAS 19 valuation uses a single discount rate set by reference to the yield on a basket of high quality sterling corporate bonds.
Significant judgement is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the basket of bonds that is used to determine the discount rate used in the IAS 19 valuations. The
criteria include issue size, quality of pricing and the exclusion of outliers. Judgement is also required in determining the shape of the yield curve at long durations; a constant credit
spread relative to gilts is assumed. Sensitivity to the main assumptions is presented below.
The weighted average duration of the Main section’s defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2024 is 13 years (2023 – 14.0 years). The chart below shows the projected benefit
payment pattern for the Main section in nominal terms. These cashflows are based on the most recent formal actuarial valuation, effective 31 December 2023.

The Group is subject to the global minimum top-up tax under Pillar Two tax legislation. The top-up tax relates to the Group’s operations in Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man and Gibraltar
where the statutory tax rate is below 15%. The Group recognised a current tax expense of £20 million related to the top-up tax (2023 - £0 million) which is levied on NatWest Group
plc.
The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.
In October 2024, Jersey enacted new tax legislation to implement a domestic minimum top-up tax, which is effective from 1 January 2025. As a result, from 2025, The Royal Bank of
Scotland International Limited will be liable for the top-up tax in relation to its operations instead of NatWest Group plc.
JJuuddggeemmeenntt:: ttaaxx ccoonnttiinnggeenncciieess
NatWest Group’s corporate income tax charge and its provisions for corporate income taxes necessarily involve a degree of estimation and judgement. The tax treatment of some
transactions is uncertain and tax computations are yet to be agreed with the relevant tax authorities. NatWest Group recognises anticipated tax liabilities based on all available
evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. Any difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect current and deferred income tax
charges in the period when the matter is resolved.

The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.
In October 2024, Jersey enacted new tax legislation to implement a domestic minimum top-up tax, which is effective from 1 January 2025. As a result, from 2025, The Royal Bank of
Scotland International Limited will be liable for the top-up tax in relation to its operations instead of NatWest Group plc.

NatWest Group’s corporate income tax charge and its provisions for corporate income taxes necessarily involve a degree of estimation and judgement. The tax treatment of some
transactions is uncertain and tax computations are yet to be agreed with the relevant tax authorities. NatWest Group recognises anticipated tax liabilities based on all available
evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. Any difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect current and deferred income tax
charges in the period when the matter is resolved.

We originate loans that include features that change the contractual cash flows based on the borrower meeting certain contractually specified environmental, social and governance
(ESG) targets. These are known as ESG-linked, or sustainability-linked, loans. As part of the terms of these loans, the contractual interest rate is reduced or increased if the borrower
meets, or fails to meet, specific targets linked to the activity of the borrower, for example reducing carbon emissions, increasing the level of diversity at Board level, or achieving a
sustainable supply chain. ESG features are first assessed to ascertain whether the adjustment to the contractual cash flows results in a de minimis exposure to risks or volatility in
those contractual cash flows. If this is the case the classification of the loan is not affected. If the effect of the ESG feature is assessed as being more than de minimis, we apply
judgement to ensure that the ESG features do not generate compensation for risks that are not in line with a basic lending arrangement. This includes, amongst other aspects, a
review of the consistency of the ESG targets with the asset or activity of the borrower, and consideration of the targets within our risk appetite. Some of these loans are an integral
part of our climate and sustainable funding and financing target disclosed on page 13.
The table below analyses financial assets forming a component of ESG-linked loans and other products with contractual terms that could change the timing or amount of cash flows.

The level 3 sensitivities presented on the next page are calculated at a trade or low-level portfolio basis rather than an overall portfolio basis. As individual sensitivities are aggregated
FVA and CVA are actively managed by a credit and market risk hedging process, and
with no reflection of the correlated nature between instruments, the overall portfolio sensitivity may not be accurately reflected. For example, some portfolios may be negatively
therefore movements in CVA and FVA are partially offset by trading revenue on the
correlated to others, where a downwards movement in one asset would produce an upwards movement in another. However, due to the additive presentation of the above figures
hedges.
this correlation impact cannot be displayed. As such, the actual potential downside sensitivity of the total portfolio may be less than the non-correlated sum of the additive figures as
shown in the table on the next page.

Alternative assumptions are determined with reference to all available evidence including consideration of the following: quality of independent pricing information considering
consistency between different sources, variation over time, perceived tradability or otherwise of available quotes; consensus service dispersion ranges; volume of trading activity and

Whilst certain inputs used to calculate CVA, FVA and own credit adjustments are not based on observable market data, the uncertainty of these inputs is not considered to have a
significant effect on the net valuation of the related derivative portfolios and issued debt.
As such, the fair value levelling of the derivative portfolios and issued debt is not determined by CVA, FVA or own credit inputs. In addition, any fair value sensitivity driven by these
inputs is not included in the level 3 sensitivities presented.
The table below shows the high and low range of fair value of the level 3 assets and liabilities. This range incorporates the range of fair value inputs as described in the previous table.

For example, if a structured note is automatically prepaid when an equity index exceeds a certain level, the cash outflow will be included in the less than three months period,
whatever the level of the index at the year end. The settlement date of debt securities in issue, issued by certain securitisation vehicles consolidated by NatWest Group, depends on
when cash flows are received from the securitised assets. Where these assets are prepayable, the timing of the cash outflow relating to securities assumes that each asset will be
prepaid at the earliest possible date. As the repayments of assets and liabilities are linked, the repayment of assets in securitisations is shown on the earliest date that the asset can be
prepaid, as this is the basis used for liabilities.
The principal amounts of financial assets and liabilities that are repayable after 20 years or where the counterparty has no right to repayment of the principal are excluded from the
table, as are interest payments after 20 years.
The maturity of guarantees and commitments is based on the earliest possible date they would be drawn in order to evaluate NatWest Group’s liquidity position.

The following table shows an analysis of the pre-tax cash flow hedge reserve and foreign exchange hedge reserve. There is a risk that customers and counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligation to settle outstanding amounts, for which we hold expected credit losses
(ECL). The calculation of ECL considers historical, current, and forward-looking information to determine the amount we do not expect to recover. It considers losses

Accounting policy 2.3 sets out how the expected loss approach is applied. At 31 December 2024, impairment provisions amounted to £3,425 million (2023 - £3,645 million). A loan is
impaired when there is objective evidence that the cash flows will not occur in the manner expected when the loan was advanced. Such evidence includes changes in the credit rating
of a borrower, the failure to make payments in accordance with the loan agreement, significant reduction in the value of any security, breach of limits or covenants, and observable
data about relevant macroeconomic measures.
The impairment loss is the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the present value of estimated future cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate.
The measurement of credit impairment under the IFRS expected loss model depends on management’s assessment of any potential deterioration in the creditworthiness of the
borrower, its modelling of expected performance and the application of economic forecasts. All three elements require judgements that are potentially significant to the estimate of
impairment losses. For further information and sensitivity analysis, refer to Risk and capital management – Measurement uncertainty and ECL sensitivity analysis section.

they are held for strategic purposes. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are not recycled to the income statement and dividends are recognised in profit or loss except
when they represent a recovery of part of the cost of the instrument, in which case such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.
There were no significant acquisitions of equity shares in either year.
NatWest Group disposed of equity shares in VISA Inc. of £62 million (2023 – nil). In 2023, NatWest Group disposed of equity shares in Permanent TSB p.l.c of £47 million and UBS
Equity Funds of £35 million. There were no significant dividends on equity shares held at FVOCI in either year.

Non-IFRS financial measures
NatWest Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). This document contains a number of non-IFRS measures, also known as alternative performance measures, defined under the European Securities and Markets
Authority (ESMA) guidance or non-GAAP financial measures in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. These measures are adjusted
for notable and other defined items which management believes are not representative of the underlying performance of the business and which distort period-on-period
comparison.
The non-IFRS measures provide users of the financial statements with a consistent basis for comparing business performance between financial periods and information on
elements of performance that are one-off in nature. The non-IFRS measures also include the basis of calculation for metrics that are used throughout the banking industry.
These non-IFRS measures are not a substitute for IFRS measures and a reconciliation to the closest IFRS measure is presented where appropriate.

The Capital Requirements (Country by Country Reporting) Regulations
(audited)
This report has been prepared for NatWest Group to comply with the Capital Requirements (Country by Country Reporting) Regulations 2013 which implement Article 89 of the
Capital Requirements Directive IV.
This report shows the income, profit/(loss) before tax, tax paid/(received), average and spot employee numbers on a full-time equivalent basis for the entities located in the countries in
which we operate.
CCoouunnttrryy
Each subsidiary or branch is allocated to the country in which it is resident for tax purposes. The data is consolidated for all the subsidiaries and branches allocated to each country.
IInnccoommee aanndd pprrooffiitt//((lloossss)) bbeeffoorree ttaaxx
Income includes internal service fee income from other countries, which is eliminated on consolidation for accounting purposes and is shown as an elimination from total income in the
tables below. Income and profit/(loss) totals are reported in Note 4 within the Geographical segments table.
TTaaxx ppaaiidd//((rreecceeiivveedd))
Tax paid/(received) disclosed under CRD IV relates to corporation tax.
Corporation tax paid represents net cash taxes paid to/(received) from the tax authorities in each jurisdiction.
Corporation tax paid is reported on a cash basis as opposed to an accounting basis and therefore does not necessarily have a direct correlation to the reported profits or losses
arising in the year. For example, in certain jurisdictions taxable profits may be reduced as a result of the offset of tax losses brought forward from prior years; or tax payments may be
calculated with reference to prior year profits.
FFuullll ttiimmee eeqquuiivvaalleenntt eemmppllooyyeeeess ((FFTTEEss))
FTEs are allocated to the country in which they are primarily based for the performance of their employment duties. The figures disclosed represent the average number of FTEs,
including temporary staff, in each country during the period. The FTEs, including temporary staff, at 31 December 2024, have been added for completeness.
PPuubblliicc ssuubbssiiddiieess rreecceeiivveedd
No public subsidies were received during the period.
