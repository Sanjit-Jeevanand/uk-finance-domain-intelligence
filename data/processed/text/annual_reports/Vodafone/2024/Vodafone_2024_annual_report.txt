evaluating the historical accuracy of management’s business plans, which underpin the VIU model, by comparing prior years’ forecasts to
actual results;
– comparing forecast capital expenditure to actual historical spend, market specific events such as fibre and 5G roll-out, industry analysis and
competitor data, where available;
– with the support of EY valuation specialists, comparing the long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions to EY independently
determined ranges;
– performing sensitivity analyses on the above-described assumptions in the VIU model, to evaluate whether a reasonable change in
assumptions would cause an impairment of the Germany CGU or indicate additional disclosures were appropriate; and
– in considering the existence of contrary evidence, for management’s assessment of implied recoverable value, we compared the Germany
CGU EBITDAaL multiple to market listed peers and considered independent analyst valuations for the Germany CGU, where available.
We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures provided in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, in particular the sensitivity
disclosures in relation to reasonably possible changes in assumptions that could result in impairment.
Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee
We agree with management’s conclusion that no impairment charge is required to be recognised in the year in respect of the Germany CGU.
The disclosures in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Germany CGU are consistent with the requirements of IAS 36
including the sensitivity disclosures, which reflect those changes in certain key assumptions that would eliminate the headroom of €2.3 billion.

Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee
We agree with the recognition of the deferred tax assets and consequently the long recoverability period, on the basis of forecast profits, which are
considered probable, given the commercial rationale and management’s intention to retain current activities in Luxembourg and the debt levels in
Vodafone Germany, over the longer term, and the track record of historical profitability in the Luxembourg operations.
The increase in the period of utilisation in FY24 is consistent with expectations of future interest rate reductions, driving lower forecast taxable profits
on forecast financing activities.
Changes in key assumptions, in particular a plausible reduction in the level of intra-group debt levels with Germany, could lead to an increase in
utilisation period beyond 60 years. The Group does not currently recognise deferred tax assets which are forecast to be used 60 years beyond the
balance sheet date and consequently, should the assumptions change, a different conclusion could be reached in respect of the level of deferred tax
asset recognised.
We consider that the disclosures included within Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements acknowledges both the judgement made in respect
of the timing and profile of the utilisation of the losses in the short to medium term and the longer-term uncertainties in relation to the carrying value
of the related deferred tax asset.

Notes:
1 See note 17 ‘Called up share capital’.
2 Includes share premium, capital reserve, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve and share-based payment reserve. The merger reserve was derived from acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2004 and subsequently
allocated to additional paid-in capital on adoption of IFRS.
3 The currency reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations. These differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
MMaarrgghheerriittaa DDeellllaa VVaallllee LLuukkaa MMuucciicc 4 The revaluation surplus derives from acquisitions of subsidiaries made before the Group’s adoption of IFRS 3 (Revised) on 1 April 2010 and comprises the amounts arising from recognising the Group’s pre-existing equity
GGrroouupp CChhiieeff EExxeeccuuttiivvee GGrroouupp CChhiieeff FFiinnaanncciiaall OOffffiicceerr interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value.
5 Principally includes the impact of the Group’s cash flow hedges with €2,037 million net loss deferred to other comprehensive income/(expense) during the year (2023: €2,322 million net gain; 2022: €3,704 million net gain)
and €254 million net gain (2023: €896 million net gain; 2022: €1,422 million net gain) recycled to the consolidated income statement. These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed borrowings, with
any foreign exchange on nominal balances directly impacting income statement in each period but interest cash flows unwinding to the consolidated income statement over the life of the hedges, up to 2063. See note 22
‘Capital and financial risk management’.
6 Movements include the re-issue of 1,519 million shares (€1,903 million) in March 2022 to satisfy the second tranche of the Mandatory Convertible Bond issued in March 2019.
7 Principally relates to transactions in relation to Vantage Towers A.G. See note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ for details.
8 Represents the irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programmes which completed on 15 March 2023.
9 Includes a gain on disposal of Vantage Towers A.G. of €8,607 million and a gain on disposal of Vodafone Ghana of €689 million, offset by a loss on disposal of Vodafone Hungary of €69 million.

Revenue recognition
Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data and the use of management
judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements and source of estimation uncertainty are
disclosed below.
Gross versus net presentation
If the Group has control of goods or services when they are delivered to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer;
otherwise the Group is acting as an agent. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by
management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the
amount of reported revenue and operating expenses (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’) but do not impact reported
assets, liabilities or cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for example, those
where the Group delivers third-party branded software or services (such as premium music, TV content or cloud-based services) to customers and
those where goods or services are delivered to customers in partnership with a third-party.

end of the lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any periods for which the Group is ‘reasonably certain’ to

Netherlands tax case
Vodafone Europe BV (‘VEBV’) received assessments totalling €267 million of tax and interest from the Dutch tax authorities, who challenged the
application of the arm’s length principle in relation to various intra-group financing transactions. The Group entered into a guarantee for the full
value of the assessments issued. VEBV appealed against these assessments to the District Court of the Hague where a hearing was held in March
2023. The District Court issued its judgement in July 2023, upholding VEBV’s appeal in relation to the majority of issues and requiring the Dutch tax
authorities to significantly reduce its assessments. VEBV and the Dutch tax authorities have since appealed the judgement. The appeal hearing date
is not yet known but is expected to be before the end of 2024.
The Group continues to believe it has robust defences but has recorded a provision of €24 million for tax and interest, reflecting the Group’s current
view of the probable financial outflow required to fully resolve the issue and has reduced the guarantee to the same value.

Netherlands tax case
Vodafone Europe BV (‘VEBV’) received assessments totalling €267 million of tax and interest from the Dutch tax authorities, who challenged the
application of the arm’s length principle in relation to various intra-group financing transactions. The Group entered into a guarantee for the full
value of the assessments issued. VEBV appealed against these assessments to the District Court of the Hague where a hearing was held in March
2023. The District Court issued its judgement in July 2023, upholding VEBV’s appeal in relation to the majority of issues and requiring the Dutch tax
authorities to significantly reduce its assessments. VEBV and the Dutch tax authorities have since appealed the judgement. The appeal hearing date
is not yet known but is expected to be before the end of 2024.
The Group continues to believe it has robust defences but has recorded a provision of €24 million for tax and interest, reflecting the Group’s current
view of the probable financial outflow required to fully resolve the issue and has reduced the guarantee to the same value.

appeal. Vodacom South Africa is challenging the SCA’s judgement and order on various grounds including, but not limited to the SCA ignoring the
evidence placed before it on the computation of the quantum of compensation payable to Mr Makate, and the SCA issuing orders that are legally
unenforceable.
The CEO’s determination in 2019 amounted to R47 million (€2 million). The minority judgement of the SCA raised Mr Makate’s compensation to
approximately R186 million (€9 million), while the SCA majority judgement would entitle Mr Makate to a minimum compensation amount of R29
billion (€1.4 billion). Consequently, the range of the possible compensation outcomes in this matter is very wide.
The amount ultimately payable to Mr Makate is uncertain and will depend on the determination of the Constitutional Court to grant Vodacom
South Africa’s application for leave to appeal and, if granted, on the success of Vodacom South Africa’s appeal against the judgement and order of
the SCA, on the merits of the case. The Group is continuing to challenge the level of compensation payable to Mr Makate and a provision immaterial
to the financial statements has been recorded.

appeal. Vodacom South Africa is challenging the SCA’s judgement and order on various grounds including, but not limited to the SCA ignoring the
evidence placed before it on the computation of the quantum of compensation payable to Mr Makate, and the SCA issuing orders that are legally
unenforceable.
The CEO’s determination in 2019 amounted to R47 million (€2 million). The minority judgement of the SCA raised Mr Makate’s compensation to
approximately R186 million (€9 million), while the SCA majority judgement would entitle Mr Makate to a minimum compensation amount of R29
billion (€1.4 billion). Consequently, the range of the possible compensation outcomes in this matter is very wide.
The amount ultimately payable to Mr Makate is uncertain and will depend on the determination of the Constitutional Court to grant Vodacom
South Africa’s application for leave to appeal and, if granted, on the success of Vodacom South Africa’s appeal against the judgement and order of
the SCA, on the merits of the case. The Group is continuing to challenge the level of compensation payable to Mr Makate and a provision immaterial
to the financial statements has been recorded.

has not published its individual cash flow statement as its liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependent on the Group rather than its

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of Company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is
revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Management regularly reviews the accounting judgements and critical estimates that could potentially significantly impact the amounts
recognised in the financial statements and give rise to material adjustments in the Company’s financial statements.
A source of estimation uncertainty for the Company relates to the review for impairment of investment carrying values and the estimates used
when determining the recoverable value of the investment. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment from
revisions to these assumptions within the next financial year (see note 2 ‘Fixed assets’).
