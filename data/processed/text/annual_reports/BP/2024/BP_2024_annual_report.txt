Growing shareholder value
We are fundamentally resetting bp’s strategy.
We are reallocating capital to drive growth from
our highest returning businesses. And we are
focused on driving improved performance.
This is all in service of growing long-term
shareholder value.
We believe bp has a compelling investor proposition, sustainably
delivering long-term shareholder value through the energy
transition, see page 19.
Our reset strategy
We plan to grow the upstream, focus the downstream and
invest with discipline in transition, see page 8.

is replacement cost profit before interest and tax, which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses« from profit

Dear fellow shareholders,

demonstrates a clear focus on actions to drive
performance improvement and grow cash flow

the most serious tier 1 events down significantly
– but we have more to do. Our goal is to
eliminate fatalities, life-changing injuries and the

Evaluation outcome
In 2024 eight new material capex investments were approveda. All were evaluated as being consistent with the Paris goals, taking into account both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations and the balanced criteria above.
Evaluation of investment performance against quantitative guide levelsb
Seven of the eight investments exceeded the relevant IRR guide level as shown in the chart. The IRR of the remaining investment was slightly below
its central price IRR hurdle.
Three of the four upstream hydrocarbon projects had emissions intensities below the relevant upstream intensity guide level. The other upstream
investment had an emissions intensity above the guide level, but was expected to reduce our operational emissions intensity in the region. The four
other investments were in businesses for which there was no applicable carbon intensity guide. These latter investments are shown as ‘n/a’ in the

This is because one did not reach a final investment decision during 2024 and the other was a transaction to progress certain bp low carbon energy assets by contributing them to a joint venture. All of
the assets that were material had been previously disclosed as new material capex investments in bp’s Annual Report and Form 20-F for the relevant year.
b The 2024 investments have been compared to relevant guides (as applicable to the evaluation of each investment) and are presented here in order of the ratio to the relevant central-price case IRR
guide level (or where there was no relevant central price IRR guide level, the lower price one), and separately in order of the ratio to the relevant emissions intensity guide level. As a result, the
evaluations against the economic and sustainability benchmarks do not necessarily follow the same order.

Sustainability
Sustainability at bp
Our sustainability frame underpins the delivery of our strategy. It focuses on three areas – getting to
net zero, improving people’s lives and caring for our planet.
In February 2025, as part of our strategy reset, we announced we would simplify the aims we have set as part of our sustainability frame to focus on the
areas that we believe are most relevant to bp’s long-term success. We now have five aims: net zero operations«, net zero sales«, people, biodiversity and
water. In some areas we have retired aims we had previously set; however, in many cases work continues in those areas. We provide an update on our
actions on those aims, and our wider progress in relation to embedding sustainability, in our latest Sustainability Report bp.com/sustainability.

Alternatively, demand and/or prices for oil and natural gas and refined products during the next decade could
be higher than our financial planning assumptions under certain transition pathways, including those aligned
with the Paris Agreement. This could strengthen returns from our hydrocarbon businesses (including securing
higher proceeds from assets we choose to divest) which may enable us to deliver enhanced shareholder value,
further strengthen our balance sheet and grow investment in the transition, in line with our financial frame.
#2 Several factors could restrict the growth of our transition businesses« or returns from them. These factors
include: lack of, or insufficient development and application of, policies, regulations and frameworks that

longer-term risk.
transition.
Alternatively, demand, policy support or enabling technology and supply chain growth for renewables
could support a more rapid portfolio shift with expansion of our low carbon businesses and higher returns
from them.
Some low carbon businesses, including renewable power, bioenergy and emerging technologies such as
hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS), rely on policy support to promote growth. We aim to
advocate more actively for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing (see page 39).
Changes in customer preferences, pace of technology and infrastructure development and deployment and
costs could impact the markets for low carbon products and services. For example, the pace of adoption of
electric vehicles (EV) could impact utilization rates, and consequently returns, from our EV charging networks.
We recognize that the pace of our transition relative to our core low carbon target sectors and regions is
important. If we move more slowly than those markets, we may miss investment opportunities and customers
may prefer different suppliers with potential negative consequences to demand for our products and to our
reputation. If we move faster than these markets, we risk investing in technologies or low carbon products that
are unsuccessful because there is insufficient demand for them. However, our investment may also help to
stimulate demand and provide us with a leading position in growth markets.
#3 Negative perceptions of the energy sector, or bp, could have a number of consequences, for example:

of both low carbon energy and fossil fuels. The bp Energy Outlook 2024 (as described on page 7) highlights
that, although the structure of energy demand will likely change over the long term, with the importance of
fossil fuels declining, replaced by a growing share of low carbon energy, led by wind and solar power, oil and
natural gas continue to play a significant role in the global energy system for the next 10-15 years. This
requires continuing investment in upstream oil and natural gas.
The insights from the bp Energy Outlook 2024 support our view that investment into oil and gas will be needed
for decades to come and also that, while the pace and shape of the transition in the long run is uncertain, we
continue to see the energy transition as a significant opportunity to grow value.
Perceived inconsistencies between the pace of bp’s transition and societal expectations could have
reputational and commercial impacts that might impair our ability to deliver our strategy. However, we also
see potential to positively differentiate bp, by delivering against our strategy, net zero ambition and
sustainability aims.

Board activities: promoting long-term sustainable success
In 2024 the board and its committees held regular meetings as needed to address business requirements. Agendas were set in advance by the chair, CEO,
and company secretary, focusing on four pillars of strategy, performance, people, and governance.
The board's activities, supported by its committees, spanned these pillars. Notably, overseas trips to both Houston, US, and across India allowed the
board to engage directly with a range of stakeholders. Highlights of the board’s activities, discussions and approvals during the year are provided below.

Our stakeholders
Regular stakeholder engagement allows directors to gain a wide range of different insights, giving the board a comprehensive and rounded perspective in
support of the decisions it takes. Engagement of this nature helps the directors to fulfil their statutory duties and build greater trust within, across, and
outside of bp. In turn this helps improve how the strategy is formed and overseen to promote bp’s long-term success.

Corporate governance
Key decisions
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires directors to act in a way they believe will promote the success of the company for the benefit of its
shareholders. They must consider the long-term impact of their decisions, the interests of employees, relationships with stakeholders, the community and
environment, and maintain high standards of business conduct.
Set out below are four key decisions taken by the board during 2024 and how stakeholder considerations have been taken into account in the board’s
discussions and decision making.

Engaging with our workforce
As a committee, we spend considerable time on matters relating to performance and remuneration arrangements across
the wider workforce. We believe that our people are the key to bp’s success and our approach to performance and reward
should be fair and consistent across the organization.
Alignment of executive and workforce remuneration
All employees Element of remuneration Executive directors
Salary is the basis for a competitive total reward
package for all employees, and we conduct an annual
salary review for all non-unionized employees.
In setting pay budgets, we assess how employee pay is
currently positioned relative to market rates, wage
inflation, forecasts and business context.
â Salary â
The salaries of our executive directors are reviewed
annually, along the same timeline as the wider
workforce.
The review of salaries will take into account the same
factors considered for the wider workforce. Salary
increases for executive directors will typically be at or
below the workforce rate, other than in specific
circumstances.
We operate different pension plans by location and for
those parts of our business where market practice is
markedly different, e.g. our retail business.
For our population of non-retail employees in the UK, we
provide a flexible cash benefits allowance of 20% of
salary. The benefits available are aligned with
competitive market practice in our different
jurisdictions.
â Pensions and benefits â
Executive directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of
pension aligned with the wider workforce (currently 20%
of salary).
Other than the provisions of car, security and tax
preparation related benefits, benefit packages are
broadly aligned with those of other employees in
the UK.
More than half of the eligible workforce participate in an
annual cash bonus plan that multiplies a grade-based
target bonus amount by a bp performance factor
derived from the bonus scorecard.
Select participants may be nominated to receive an
uplift to their bonus outcome, reflecting their personal
contribution and impact.
We operate different bonus plans for those distinct
parts of our business where market practice is
markedly different.
â Annual bonus â
The annual bonus for the executive directors is linked
to the same bp performance factor as for the wider
workforce.
Executive directors are not entitled to a bonus uplift
linked to individual performance.
For executive directors, a portion of any award is
deferred into shares for three years. The deferral rate
depends on whether the executive director has met
their minimum shareholding requirement.
We operate share plans with three-year vesting for all
our senior leaders.
Opportunity varies across two broad tiers: group
leaders (approximately 300) and senior-level leaders
(approximately 4,500).
â Performance shares â
Corporate governance
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Executive directors are eligible for performance share
awards, which are subject to stretching performance
targets over a three-year period.

against net zero operations milestones. The most significant reductions in
the year came from flaring reductions and increased reliability in the
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Türkiye region and efficient project start-ups.
Emission reduction projects totalling 0.42MtCOe implemented by our

business in 2024 included: our Gelsenkirchen refinery replaced imported
steam from a coal-fired power plant with steam produced in our own gas-
fired boilers; bpx energy’s central distribution projects, Karnes and Bingo,
which enabled decommissioning of legacy natural gas-driven equipment;
and restoration of cooling water infrastructure at Cherry Point to reliably
meet refinery needs and improve the efficiency of compressor operations.
Further detail on safety and sustainability performance over the year is
provided in the safety and sustainability committee (S&SC) report on
page 80.
Reliability and availability is a combined measure of bp-operated refining
availability« and bp-operated plant reliability« with a performance outcome
of 94.7% – achieving a nil outcome. Plant reliability strengthened year-on-
year to 95.2% (95.0% in 2023). However, refining availability was impacted
by the Whiting power outage in Q1 2024 and was below threshold at 94.3%.
Transition growth« engine adjusted EBITDA« (% growth) was introduced
as a more holistic measure focused on transition growth engine financial
delivery over the year. The measure is assessed based on annual growth
against a 2023 baseline and has achieved a nil vesting outcome. This was
primarily driven by lower than expected delivery in bioenergy, convenience
and power trading.
Financial performance, as measured by modified free cash flow« and
adjusted EBITDA, was below target. bp generated modified free cash flow
of $12.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $38.0 billion, which resulted in a nil
outcome for both measures. Our targets are environment-adjusted at year-
end and the revised targets for modified free cash flow and adjusted
EBITDA were $14.7 billion and $40.9 billion respectively.
Overall outcome
The formulaic score for the 2024 annual bonus was 22.5% of maximum.
The committee considered bp’s framework on fatalities when reflecting on
the formulaic outcome. Sadly, there was one fatality during the year within
our recently acquired biofuels business. Full details on the application of
the framework have been provided on page 98.
Having considered the above, alongside a holistic review of performance,
the committee determined that no discretion would be applied to the
formulaic outcome for executive directors.

Strategic progress
Overview of strategic progress (2022-24)
Performance of this measure has been challenging to assess as it spans a three-year period that has seen significant change. Our strategy has continued
to evolve and update and the criteria we set back at the start of the performance period (2022) to judge progress do not fully reflect current expectations.
Alongside assessment against three key pillars (established in 2022), the committee have also taken a broader review of the shareholder experience over
the performance period. Further, there has been consideration of mid-cycle changes we have experienced during the performance period, such as bp’s
updated transition strategy in February 2023 and the key strategic initiatives during 2024 which have laid our foundation for growth. In summary:
• Resilient hydrocarbons: Performed well across the board, with strong production delivery, plant reliability« and unit costs. This was offset by
operational challenges during the period which primarily impacted refining availability«. Ultimately, financial performance was strong against this pillar.
• Low carbon energy: Progress was mixed with a number of key initiatives completed as management adapted to our evolving strategy and tough
market conditions.
• Convenience and mobility: bp performed well across our suite of volume measures, but a very challenging market meant financial delivery was lower
than expected.
Overall performance: During the period, bp has achieved a number of strategic milestones – particularly in the last year of the performance period – and is
well positioned to drive future growth.

• The low carbon energy pillar has materially transformed since the setting of targets in 2022. From a period of volume-driven origination, bp has
moved into a stage of consolidation, portfolio reset and focus across all businesses within a more constrained capital frame.
• Low carbon energy delivered lower adjusted EBITDA than expected over the period. This was attributable to the challenging solar market in the US
in 2023 and rapid ramp-up in hydrogen and offshore wind.

Overview
• Performance across the convenience and mobility pillar has been strong versus the targets we set at the beginning of 2022. However, market
conditions have been challenging which has impacted financial delivery, leading to mixed performance.
• During the period, financial performance was impacted by cost inflation, challenging market environments and prolonged impact of COVID-19 on
businesses such as Castrol.

Overall assessment
In progressing our strategic agenda, we have not only reviewed performance against the three strategic pillars of our previous strategy but also key
strategic highlights, many of which culminated in the last year of the performance period, including:

Other vesting considerations
Along with the results from the scorecard measures, the committee considers an ‘underpin’ to the formulaic outcome in order to determine the final
vesting percentage. The underpin broadens our performance assessment, allowing us to consider vesting outcomes with overall alignment to absolute
shareholder returns, environmental and safety factors and progress in matters relating to low carbon and climate change. Where relevant, we take input
from the safety and sustainability committee and the audit committee to deepen and enhance our perspective.
Having considered the above, the committee concluded that the vesting outcome was suitably reflective of the company’s underlying performance and the
experience of shareholders overall. The committee agreed it was not necessary to apply discretion to the formulaic outcome and approved vesting of
66.5% for the 2022-24 EDIP award. This decision yields the outcome shown in the table below for the CEO. The scorecard detail is shown on page 99.

Measures for the 2025 annual bonus
Provided below is a summary of the performance measures we have chosen for the 2025 annual bonus plan scorecard. The targets are commercially sensitive and
will be disclosed in the 2025 directors’ remuneration report.
We are replacing our earnings (adjusted EBITDA«) measure with structural cost reductions« to better align with the financial priorities set out in the Capital Markets
Update announcement in February 2025. This measure will be assessed against a 2023 baseline and is positioned to capture sustainable cost reductions that can
be maintained beyond 2027.
In line with our reset strategy, the measure on transition growth« engines has been removed from the scorecard for 2025. In the interest of simplification, the
committee determined that the scorecard should be kept to five measures. The weighting of modified free cash flow« and bp-operated reliability« and availability«
will be increased – from 25% to 30% and 10% to 15% respectively. This change mirrors our focus on cash generation and driving strong operations for 2025.
Importantly, the framework on fatalities will continue to apply to the 2025 annual bonus and will be considered at year-end if a fatality occurs during the year.

Measures for the 2025-27 performance shares (EDIP)
Provided below is a summary of the measures we have chosen for the 2025-27 performance share plan. The four categories remain unchanged from the prior year
and there has been no change to respective weightings.
Under our financials category, we are proposing to introduce an adjusted free cash flow CAGR measure (20% weight) and to modify the ROACE measure to align
with our strategic commitments. The committee reflected on the dual focus of free cash flow in the short and long-term incentive scorecards and determined it was
appropriate given our strategic focus on cash generation – with adjusted free cash flow being a primary target in bp’s reset strategy. The two cash measures;
modified free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow CAGR are different, with the former covering a holistic view of in-year cash generation (including working capital
and proceeds) and the latter representing underlying free cash flow growth, removing more volatile items, in line with our external targets. The ROACE measure now
fully aligns with our external targets with measurement at the end of 2027.
For strategic progress, the measure will remain subject to the committee’s judgement at the end of the three-year period. The judgement of performance will take
into account progress against the financial targets set under our reset strategy – including reference to measures such as divestments, net debt« and structural
cost reductions. This will be alongside our holistic review of progress against our strategy, to ensure that outcomes are aligned with the shareholder experience.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Stewardship and executive director interests
We believe that our executive directors should build and maintain a material interest in the company. Our policy therefore requires the CEO and CFO to
build a personal shareholding of five times and four and a half times, respectively, their salary within five years of their appointment. They are expected to
maintain this level of personal shareholdings for two years post-employment.
Directors’ shareholdings and aggregated interests (audited)
The table below details the personal shareholdings of each executive director. These figures include all beneficial and non-beneficial ownership of shares
of bp (or calculated equivalents) that have been disclosed to the company. Murray Auchincloss has met the minimum shareholding requirement (MSR)
under the policy. Kate Thomson is expected to satisfy the policy requirement that applies five years from her date of appointment, 2 February 2024. The
committee has reviewed and confirmed this position and will continue to monitor compliance with this policy.

Executive directors have additional interests in performance and deferred bonus shares. These interests are shown in aggregate in the table above, and
interests awarded during 2024 in the tables below. For performance shares, the figures reflect maximum possible vesting levels (excluding the addition of
reinvested dividends) even though the actual number of shares that vest will depend on the extent to which performance conditions are satisfied.

a The face value of awards granted during 2024 have been calculated using a market price of ordinary shares at close on the date of award, as follows: £5.04 on 7 May 2024. In calculating the number of
ordinary shares over which these awards were made, the committee applied the average price of ordinary shares over the 90 calendar days up to and including the annual general meeting that was held
on 25 April 2024 (£4.89).
b Performance conditions are measured 15% on cumulative reduction % in operated carbon emissions, 25% on TSR relative to Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, TotalEnergies, Eni, Equinor and Repsol over three
years, 20% ROACE averaged over the performance period, 20% adjusted EBIDA per share CAGR measured vs. year ended June 2020 and 20% strategic progress assessed over the performance period.
Minimum vesting under this award (below threshold performance) is 0%. At threshold performance, vesting would be 6.25% of maximum.
Since 2010, vesting of the performance shares under EDIP has been subject to a safety underpin. If the committee assesses that there has been a material deterioration in safety performance, or there
have been major incidents, either of which reveal underlying weaknesses in safety management, then it may conclude that shares should vest only in part, or not at all. In reaching its conclusion, the
committee obtains advice from the S&SC.
The performance period is 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026.
The 2025 performance share awards under EDIP are expected to be made following the conclusion of the 2025 annual general meeting.
c There is no identified minimum vesting threshold level. The 2024 bonus year deferred share awards under EDIP are expected to be made following the conclusion of the 2025 annual general meeting.
Directors and leadership team
No directors or other leadership team members own more than 1% of the shares in issue. At 14 February 2025, our directors and leadership team
members collectively held interests of 6,288,180 ordinary shares or their calculated equivalents, 4,339,104 restricted share units (with or without
conditions) or their calculated equivalents, 7,399,346 performance shares or their calculated equivalents and 6,174,714 options over ordinary shares or

Fee structure
The table below shows the fee structure for the chair and non-executive directors (NEDs). The chair is not eligible for committee chairship and
membership fees. The senior independent director (SID) is eligible for committee chairship and membership fees, and their fee includes the board member
fee. Committee chairs do not receive a membership fee for the committee they chair.
Under the 2023 policy, fee levels are reviewed annually alongside wider workforce salaries and any changes are put into effect from 1 April. Taking all
factors into consideration, for 2025 the board agreed to implement a 4% increase to the base fee for NEDs and for the SID, aligned with the salary increase
budget for the UK wider workforce. Determination of the fees payable to the chair falls to the remuneration committee, which agreed to align the
percentage increase of the chair's fee with the other NEDs. Following board and remuneration committee approval, the remuneration arrangements for the
chair and NEDs will be adjusted with effect from 1 April 2025.

a Bob Dudley’s pay has been converted from US dollars as per the ratios reported in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020.
b For 2023, the total single figure used to derive the CEO pay ratio is a combination of the two individuals in position of CEO during the year. In respect of the former CEO, the calculation has been based on
the total single figure excluding the impact of malus and clawback in order to provide a comparison with prior years. Appropriate pro-rating of fixed and variable pay has been applied.
c Share price for the CEO share plan vesting has been based on the average share price over Q4 of the 2024 FY of £3.90.
This is our sixth year reporting the CEO pay ratio following the requirements introduced in 2018. As per the past five years, we have selected Option A as
our reporting basis, being the most accurate approach available, and we confirm that no broadly applicable components of pay have been omitted. Where
necessary, full-time equivalent pay has been calculated by simple engrossment of part-year values. Employee values relate to pay and benefits for the year
ended 31 December 2024.
Changes in the pay ratio over time reflect the fact that CEO remuneration is more heavily weighted to variable pay, resulting in larger year-on-year swings
than wider workforce pay. This is evidenced by the variability of the CEO pay ratio over the past six years. This volatility in the pay ratio reporting from year
to year is expected, and illustrates one of the challenges in commenting on whether the pay differentials are appropriate. In 2024, the 50th percentile pay
ratio decreased from 103:1 to 74:1. This was largely driven by the outcomes of the CEO’s variable awards, with the lowest bonus outcome in the past 10
years (excluding nil bonus for 2020) and the performance share award being granted at a lower multiple of salary when he was in position as CFO.
The committee believes in performance-based remuneration. For all employees eligible to participate in the annual cash bonus plan, there is an individual
uplift available each year which allows managers to nominate individuals based on their personal contributions during the year. For senior leaders, a
significant portion of the remuneration package continues to be linked to performance-based reward. It is therefore the view of the committee that the
remuneration frameworks we have in place for executive directors and the wider workforce are fit-for-purpose and deliver pay outcomes appropriate to the
circumstances of the year, with differentials that reflect the relative contributions made at different levels of the organization.
The committee is satisfied that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with bp’s pay policies for employees and does not constitute a reason
to modify our pay programmes.
Percentage change comparisons: directors’ remuneration versus employees
In the table below, values in column ‘a’ represent the percentage change in salary and fees; values in column ‘b’ represent the percentage change in taxable
benefits; and values in column ‘c’ represent the percentage change in bonus outcomes for performance periods in respect of each financial year. For the
purposes of comparison, the employee percentages shown below represent the relative change between the median full-time equivalent pay for every
employee employed at BP p.l.c. at any point during the relevant financial year, and the equivalent median value for the preceding financial year. Where
increases are infinite relative to the preceding year, we have shown them as 100% for illustration, where a director was appointed or retired part-way
through the year we have annualized pay except for one-time items, and where comparison to the prior year is not possible we have used dashes.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
Independence and advice
The board considers all committee members to be independent with no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the committee’s
decisions. Further detail on the activities of the committee in 2024 is set out in the remuneration committee report on page 88.
During 2024 Ben Mathews, who was employed by the company and reported to the chair of the board, acted as secretary to the remuneration committee.
The committee also received advice on various matters relating to the remuneration of executive directors and senior management from Kerry Dryburgh,
EVP people, culture & communications and Ashok Pillai, SVP reward.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) continued to provide independent advice to the committee in 2024. PwC advice included, for example, support with
remuneration benchmarking and updates on market practice. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operates under the
code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration in the UK. The committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent. The
committee is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team who provide remuneration advice to the committee do not have connections with
the company or its directors that may impair their independence.
Total fees or other charges (based on an hourly rate) for the provision of remuneration advice to the committee in 2024 (save in respect of legal advice)
were £88,751 to PwC. Freshfields LLP (Freshfields) provided legal advice on specific compliance matters to the committee. PwC and Freshfields provide
other advice in their respective areas to the group.
Considerations related to the UK Corporate Governance Code
When setting the 2023 policy, the committee concluded that a scorecard-based approach to setting targets and measuring outcomes helps it to engage
transparently with shareholders and the wider workforce on remuneration. Thus, bp continues to operate a simple, clear structure of market-aligned salary
with annual and three-year performance-based incentives. Risks are managed through careful setting of performance measures and targets and the
committee retains the exercise of its discretion in assessing outcomes. These are complemented with robust malus and clawback measures.
Remuneration outcomes are predictable, as shown in the implementation charts of the 2023 policy, and proportional by virtue of the challenging
performance levels required to achieve target pay outcomes. Through material weighting in measures related to safety, sustainability and strategy, as
shown on page 104, remuneration aligns closely with bp’s culture, as expressed through our purpose and ambition.
Shareholder engagement
Throughout 2024 the committee engaged frequently on remuneration policy and approach with bp’s largest shareholders, as well as their representative
bodies. This dialogue will continue throughout 2025. The table below shows the recent votes on the directors’ remuneration report and policy.
Year % vote ‘for’ % vote ‘against’ Votes withheld

Service contracts and letters of appointment
The service contracts of executive directors do not have a fixed term. Service contracts for each executive director are available for shareholders to view
upon request at the company’s registered office. Each executive director’s service contract contains a 12-month notice period. Consistent with the best
interests of the group, the committee will seek to minimize termination payments.

The non-executive directors (NEDs) have letters of appointment, which are available for shareholders to view upon request at the company’s registered
office. All directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the annual general meeting. Normally, NEDs will be encouraged to serve for up to
nine years from their appointment in line with the provisions of the 2018 Code, subject to annual re-election.
External appointments
The board supports executive directors taking up appointments outside the company to broaden their knowledge and experience. Each executive director
is permitted to retain any fee from their external appointments. Such external appointments are subject to agreement by the chair and reported to the
board. Any external appointment must not conflict with a director’s duties and commitments to bp. Details of appointments as NEDs of publicly listed
companies during 2024 are shown below.

Consolidated financial statements of the bp group
Independent auditor’s report to the members of BP p.l.c.
Report on the audit of the financial statements
1. Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements of BP p.l.c. (the ‘parent company’ or ‘bp’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’ or ‘bp’) give a true and fair view of the state of the
group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2024 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRS
Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU);
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of BP p.l.c which comprise the:
• group and parent company income statements
• group and parent company statements of comprehensive income
• group and parent company statements of changes in equity
• group and parent company balance sheets
• group cash flow statement
• group related Notes 1 to 38 to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policy information and
• parent company related Notes 1 to 14 to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policy information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law, United Kingdom adopted
international accounting standards and IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the EU. The financial reporting framework
that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom accounting standards, including
FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice).
2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those
standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial
statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the group and parent company for the
year are disclosed in Note 36 to the financial statements.
We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard to the group or the parent company, with the
exception of Deloitte UAE providing an additional service of rolling forward a BP p.l.c.’s subsidiary’s financial statements. The service was administrative in
nature and there were no calculations or judgements applied when carrying out this exercise. In our opinion, based on no fees being charged for the
services and the size of the component, the impact of providing the services was immaterial and inconsequential, however this is a breach, albeit
insignificant, of the Ethical Standard. Following investigation, we have concluded in agreement with the Audit Committee that given the size of the services
provided and their potential impact, as well as the safeguards in place, our objectivity and impartiality has not been impaired, and we believe that a
reasonable and informed third party with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that we are capable of exercising objective
and impartial judgement on all matters related to the audit.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

3. Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• potential impact of climate change and the energy transition
• impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets
• decommissioning provisions
• valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition, and
• management override of controls.
In the current year, we re-considered whether the accounting for complex transactions remains a key audit matter. While the
group continues to enter into such transactions, these transactions have significantly reduced in magnitude compared with the
prior year. Consequently, accounting for these transactions was not included as a key audit matter, as they do not have a material
impact on the group's financial statements. We designed and performed audit procedures relative to the risk levels determined
through the application of our consistent framework for evaluating complex transactions. These procedures were adjusted, as
necessary, based on the nature, scale, and complexity of the transactions assessed during the year.
All other key audit matters are consistent with those we identified in the prior year and the developments in fact patterns of these
previously identified key audit matters are explained in the respective sections below.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was $800 million (2023 $1,000 million) which was determined
based on cash flow from operations and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.
We adopted a different basis to determine materiality used to audit the group financial statements this year due to the impact of
changing macroeconomic conditions, one-off transactions and strategic decisions on the group’s profit before tax. In the prior
year we determined materiality based on profit before tax and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.
Scoping Our scope covered 178 consolidation units (cons units). Of these, 153 were subject to audits of specified account balances and 25
were subject to specified audit procedures by the component audit teams or group audit team. These covered 69% of revenue,
73% of PP&E and 72% of profit before tax. The remaining 765 cons units were subject to other procedures, including performing
analytical reviews, making inquiries of management, and evaluating and testing management's group-wide controls.
4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial
statements is appropriate.
Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting
included:
• assessing the financing facilities including the nature of the facilities and repayment terms;
• assessing whether the impact of potential margin calls in respect of derivative exchange contracts used to risk manage the physical portfolio has been
appropriately considered given price volatility;
• assessing management’s identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going concern assessment;
• testing the clerical accuracy of the going concern model;
• assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management;
• performing our independent sensitivity analysis; and
• assessing the disclosures made within the financial statements.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively,
may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when
the financial statements are authorised for issue.
In relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in
relation to the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of
accounting.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current
year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included
those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Throughout the course of our audit, we identify risks of material misstatement (‘risks’). We consider both the likelihood of a risk and the potential
magnitude of a misstatement in making the assessment. Certain risks are classified as ‘significant’ or ‘higher’ depending on their severity. The category of
the risk determines the level of evidence we seek in providing assurance that the associated financial statement item is not materially misstated.
The matters described below were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

5.1 Potential impact of climate change and the energy transition (impacting PP&E, goodwill, intangible assets and provisions) – Notes
1, 4, 12, 14, 15 and 33 to the financial statements
Key audit matter description Climate change impacts bp’s business in a number of ways as set out in the strategic report on pages 1-68 of the Annual
Report and Note 1 of the financial statements on page 145. It represents a strategic challenge and a key focus of
management. The related risks that we have assessed for our audit are as follows:
• Forecast assumptions used in assessing the value-in-use of oil and gas PP&E assets within bp’s balance sheet for
impairment testing, particularly oil and gas price assumptions and their interrelationship with forecast emissions costs,
may not appropriately reflect changes in supply and demand due to climate change and the energy transition (see
‘Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets’ below).
• The timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures in respect of oil and gas assets may need to be brought
forward with a resulting increase in the present value of the associated liabilities due to the impact of climate change.
In addition, there is an exposure to decommissioning obligations that may revert back to bp in respect of assets
transferred to third parties through historical divestments. The risk of exposure is increased due to the impacts of
climate change which have heightened long term financial resilience concerns for many industry participants.
Furthermore, provisions for decommissioning refining assets, not generally recognised on the basis that the potential
obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions
in demand due to climate change curtail their operational lives (see ‘Decommissioning provisions’ below).
• The recoverability of certain of the group’s $4.4 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised as at 31
December 2024 (2023 $4.3 billion) is potentially exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors
(see Note 15). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed as a consequence of the energy
transition or lower forecast future oil and gas prices. The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be
written off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex and continues to require
significant management judgement.
• The useful economic lives of the group’s refining assets may be shortened as society moves towards ‘net zero’
emissions targets and bp seeks to achieve its net zero ambition, such that the depreciation charge is materially
understated. Of the total refining assets carried in the balance sheet, all but an immaterial residual value relating
primarily to land and buildings will be fully depreciated by 2050. As disclosed in Note 1 to the accounts on page 146,
management has concluded that demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient for the existing
refineries to continue operating for the duration of their remaining useful lives and hence no changes to the useful
economic lives of its refinery assets were required.
• The carrying value of bp’s refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and
demand which arise among other things as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Management
identified impairment indicators in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany during the year and, as a result, an
impairment test was performed to assess the recoverability of the Gelsenkirchen refinery carrying value. As disclosed
in Note 4 to the accounts on page 166 management has recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 billion (2023 $1.3
billion) in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery, primarily driven by changes in economic assumptions. At 31 December
2024 management identified an impairment indicator for all of its other refineries due to a reduction in the local marker
margins. The impairment tests performed by management to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of these
refineries did not result in any additional impairment charges being recognised.
• The total goodwill balance as at 31 December 2024 is $14.9 billion (2023 $12.5 billion), of which $7.2 billion relates to
upstream oil and gas assets (2023 $7.0 billion). The carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable as a
consequence of climate change and therefore may need to be impaired. For oil production & operations (‘OP&O’) and
gas & low carbon energy (‘G&LCE’), goodwill is allocated to hydrocarbon CGUs in aggregate at the respective segment
level. Goodwill related to low carbon energy investments is held separately within the G&LCE segment. The most
significant assumption in the hydrocarbon related goodwill impairment tests affected by climate change relates to
future oil and gas prices (see ‘Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets’ below). Given the significant level of
headroom in the goodwill impairment tests, management identified no other assumption that could lead to a material
misstatement of goodwill due to the energy transition and other climate change factors. Disclosures in relation to
sensitivities for goodwill are included within Note 14 on page 179. The customers & products (C&P) segment has a
goodwill balance of $5.5 billion (2023 $5.4 billion), of which the most significant element is $2.6 billion relating to the
Castrol business (2023 $2.7 billion). Notwithstanding the expected global transition to electric vehicles which may
reduce demand for lubricants, due to the substantial headroom in the most recent impairment test (as described in
Note 14), management has assessed as remote the likelihood that the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than its
carrying value.
• Climate change-related litigation brought against bp, as disclosed in Note 33 to the financial statements, may lead to
an outflow of funds requiring provision.
Subsequent to the year end, on 26 February 2025 the group announced a strategy reset, with a consequent impact on the
group’s key targets and metrics for 2025 and beyond. This post balance sheet event has been considered by
management in the context of forecasts and assumptions as they relate to the 2024 financial statements and the matters
noted above.
The above considerations were a significant focus of management during the period which led to this being a matter that
we communicated to the audit committee, and which had a significant effect on the overall audit strategy. We therefore
identified this as a key audit matter. This matter was also discussed by the Audit Committee on page 84.

How the scope of our audit Overall response
responded to the key audit
We held discussions with management, with our Climate Change specialists and within the group engagement team to
matter
identify the areas where we felt climate change could have a potential impact on the financial statements.
We also continued to utilise a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners and specialists
with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent
challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.
Audit procedures
The audit response related to two of the audit risks identified is set out under the key audit matters for ‘Impairment of
upstream oil and gas PP&E assets’ on pages 121-123 and ‘Decommissioning provisions’ on pages 124-125. Other
procedures are as follows:
In respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024:
• We tested the relevant controls within the group’s E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes.
• We challenged and evaluated management’s key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6.
Where impairment indicators were identified, we corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for
assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital
allocation decisions, assessing management’s key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting minutes and
assessing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations
to renew licences or modify key terms.
We challenged management’s assertion that no changes are required to the assessed useful economic lives of refining
assets as a consequence of climate change factors. In doing this, we obtained third party reports assessing future refined
petroleum product demand for those countries which are included in our group full audit scope for the C&P segment. In
particular, we considered the forecasts as set out in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2024 which shows that demand for
refined petroleum products is expected to remain sufficient for at least the current remaining useful economic lives of the
refineries such that current depreciation rates are appropriate, including under the Announced Pledges Scenario which is
associated with a temperature rise of 1.7 °C in 2100 (with a 50% probability).
We considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group’s refining portfolio and assessed
internal and external market studies of future supply and demand. In relation to the refinery impairment tests performed
by management, our audit procedures included: evaluating the valuation methodology and testing the integrity and
mechanical accuracy of the impairment models; assessing the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs to the
impairment models, notably forecast local refining marker margins, discount rate and energy input costs, challenging and
evaluating management’s assumptions by reference to third party data where available and involvement of our valuation
specialists; and evaluating management’s ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results
with historical forecasts and tested management’s internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.
We performed procedures to satisfy ourselves that, other than future oil and gas price assumptions, there were no other
assumptions in management’s oil and gas goodwill impairment tests in respect of which reasonably possible changes
due to the energy transition and other climate change factors could cause goodwill to be materially misstated. We
assessed the impact of climate change on C&P segment activities and we have not noted any factors to indicate
impairment of goodwill due to climate change.
With regard to climate change litigation, we designed procedures specifically to respond to the risks that provisions could
be understated or that contingent liability disclosures may be omitted or be inaccurate including:
• holding discussions with the group general counsel and other senior bp lawyers regarding climate change matters;
• conducting a search for climate change litigation and claims brought against the group;
• making written inquiries of, and holding discussions with, external legal counsel advising bp in relation to climate
change litigation; and
• assessing the contingent liability disclosures in the annual report on pages 217-219.
With regard to the consideration of the impact of the post balance sheet strategic announcement by the group, we
performed procedures to assess the reasonableness and completeness of management’s analysis as to the impact on
forecasts and assumptions underpinning the judgements identified above.
We read the other information included in the Annual Report and considered (a) whether there was any material
inconsistency between the other information and the financial statements; and (b) whether there was any material
inconsistency between the other information and our understanding of the business based on audit evidence obtained and
conclusions reached in the audit.

Key observations Key observations in relation to oil and gas price assumptions used in oil and gas PP&E asset impairment tests, and the
impact of climate change on decommissioning provisions are set out in the relevant key audit matter below.
We concluded that the key E&A assessments had been appropriately determined and the judgements management had
made were appropriately supported. We did not identify any additional impairments or write-offs from the work we
performed.
We are satisfied:
• with the results of our procedures relating to the carrying value of refining assets and that the impairments recorded
are reasonable;
• with the results of our procedures relating to the assessment of the useful economic lives of refining assets and
therefore depreciation charges, based on the market studies we read;
• with the sensitivity analysis disclosures around the energy transition and other climate change factors performed in
respect of the goodwill balances, and that the group’s goodwill balances are not materially misstated;
• with management’s assertion that no provision should currently be made in respect of climate change litigation. Based
on the audit evidence obtained both from internal and external legal counsel, we concluded that management’s
disclosure of the contingent liabilities in respect of these matters is appropriate;
• that management’s assessment of the impact of the group’s post balance sheet strategy update on the forecasts and
assumptions as they relate to the judgements are reasonable and complete; and
• that management’s other disclosures in the Annual Report relating to climate change are consistent with the financial
statements and our understanding of the business.
Whilst many of bp’s oil and gas properties and refining assets are long term in nature, by 2050, the remaining carrying
value of assets currently being depreciated will be immaterial, this date being the target set by the majority of
governments with ‘net zero’ emissions targets and also by bp, with its sustainability aims of ‘net zero operations’ and ‘net
zero sales’. At current rates of depreciation, depletion and amortisation (‘DD&A’), the average remaining depreciable life of
the upstream oil and gas PP&E (within the OP&O and G&LCE segments) is five years and the refining assets (within the
C&P segment) is eleven years.

5.2 Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets – Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements
Key audit matter description The group balance sheet as at 31 December 2024 includes PP&E of $100 billion (2023 $105 billion), of which $56 billion
(2023 $62 billion) is oil and gas properties.
Management’s best estimate oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised in 2024 as set
out in Note 1 on page 152, although the revisions were not significant.
Management has also determined bp’s ‘best estimate’ discount rate assumptions, as set out in Note 1 on page 152. bp’s
post-tax discount rate used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets in 2024 remained unchanged from prior year at
8% (2023: 8%). Pre-tax discount rates applied in impairment tests were revised in some regions to reflect changes in local
tax rates and country risk premiums, however the impact of these revisions was insignificant. Reserves estimates for all
oil and gas fields were also reviewed and updated where necessary at year-end.
Management judged that in aggregate, the year-end oil and gas price assumption revisions, changes to pre-tax discount
rates for certain regions due to country risk premium or tax rate changes, and changes to other input assumptions
including reserves reductions on several key fields, all combined to constitute an impairment trigger for all oil and gas
cash generating units (CGUs). As a result of testing performed during 2024, $2.0 billion (2023 $3.6 billion) of oil and gas
CGU net impairment charges were recognised, principally due to certain discount rate revisions, an increase in certain
capital expenditure forecasts and operating expenditure forecasts and certain reserves write downs.
We identified three key management estimates in management’s determination of the level of impairment charge and/or
impairment reversal. These are:
Oil and gas prices – bp’s oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment
assessments performed across the OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of
future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the global energy transition, macro-
economic factors and disruption in global supply due to ongoing geo-political conflicts. There is a risk that
management do not forecast reasonable ‘best estimate’ oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for
impairment charge and/or impairment reversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions
are highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to bp’s oil and gas CGU valuation. There is also a risk that
management’s oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.
bp's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in use impairment assessments are aligned with bp’s investment
appraisal assumptions, except that potential future emissions costs that could be borne by bp are included in
investment appraisals as bp costs without assuming incremental revenue.
As described in Note 1 on page 146, emissions costs forecasts interrelate with bp’s oil and gas prices, because
bp’s price assumptions for value-in-use estimates represent ‘net producer prices’, i.e., net of any further
emissions costs that may be enacted in the future. Management’s judgement is that the potential impact of
such further emissions costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact
on bp’s oil and gas CGU carrying values as costs would effectively be borne by oil and gas end users via overall
higher commodity prices. There is a risk that management’s judgement is not reasonable.
Discount rates – Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the
discount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in
the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management does not assume reasonable discount rates,
adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a
reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate
assumption is also a pervasive input across bp’s oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset
specific risks and tax rates.
Reserves and resources estimates – A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas
production forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development
assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to
proven and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions
related to these volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise
from unreasonable production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of
systematic flaws in bp’s reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and G&LCE segments.
We identified certain individual CGUs with a total carrying value of $9 billion (2023 $18 billion) which we determined would
be most at risk of material impairment charges as a result of a reasonably possible change in the oil and gas price
assumptions. These CGUs have been subjected to $9 billion worth of previous impairments and as such, are also at risk of
material impairment reversal resulting from potential oil and gas price assumption changes. We identified that a subset of
these CGUs was also individually materially sensitive to the discount rate assumption. Accordingly, we identified these as
significant audit risks.
We also identified CGUs with a further $2 billion (2023 $2 billion) of combined carrying value which were less sensitive. We
identified these as a higher audit risk as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a
reasonably possible change in some or all of the key assumptions. No impairment reversals are available for these CGUs.
Further information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 153.
Impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a key audit
matter because recoverable values are reliant on forecast assumptions such as oil and gas prices, discount rates and
reserves estimates, which are inherently judgemental and complex for management to estimate and challenging to audit.
Additionally, the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk remains material to the group. This matter was discussed
by the Audit Committee on page 85.

How the scope of our audit We tested relevant internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates, and reserve and resources
responded to the key audit estimates, as well as relevant internal controls over the performance of the impairment charge and/or impairment reversal
matter assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.
Oil and gas prices
• We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we
compared management’s oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.
• In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and
other relevant market data.
• In challenging and evaluating management’s price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of
the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate
change and the energy transition.
• The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of ‘holding the increase in the global average
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’ was reaffirmed at CoP 29 in Baku during November 2024. We specifically analysed
third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris ‘well below 2°C
goal’ and/or ‘1.5°C ambition’ and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.
• We challenged and evaluated management’s judgement, described in Note 1 on page 146, that the potential impact of
further emission costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on bp’s oil and
gas CGU carrying values. We obtained evidence supporting that oil and gas price forecasts included in our reasonable
range are forecast on a ‘net producer prices’ basis, (i.e., net of potential future emissions costs that are assumed to be
borne by oil and gas end users), consistent with the basis of bp’s value-in-use price assumptions.
• We assessed management’s disclosures in Note 1, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower
oil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced
demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in bp’s value-in-use estimates for oil
and gas CGUs.
Discount rates
• We independently evaluated bp’s discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists,
against relevant third party market and peer data.
• When performing procedures over specific assets, we assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments
were reasonably reflected in bp’s discount rates.
• We challenged and evaluated management’s disclosures in Note 1, including in relation to the sensitivity of discount
rate assumptions.
Reserves and resources estimates
With the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:
• assessed bp’s reserves and resources estimation methods and policies for reasonableness;
• assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp’s reserves and resources estimates which included
those that we judged to represent the greatest risk of material misstatement;
• read and evaluated a sample of reports provided by management’s external reserves experts and assessed the scope
of work and findings of these third parties;
• assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of bp’s internal and external reserve experts, through
understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience;
• assessed whether management’s production forecasts are consistent overall with bp’s strategy;
• compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management’s approved reserves and resources
estimates; and
• performed a retrospective assessment in order to assess management's ability to accurately estimate reserves and
resources and to check for indications of estimation bias over time.

Key observations Oil and gas prices
For the purpose of PP&E impairment tests, management is required under IAS 36 to apply its current ‘best estimate’ of
future oil and gas prices. We determined that bp’s ‘best estimate’ assumptions are reasonable when compared against a
range of third party forecasts and peer information that we identified as being appropriate for this purpose. In forming this
view, we included each forecaster’s ‘base case’, ‘central case’ or ‘most likely’ estimate.
We further observed that, as well as publishing a ‘base case’, ‘central case’ or ‘most likely’ estimate, certain third party price
forecasters including the IEA published other price forecasts including some that were stated as, or were interpreted by us
as being, Paris ‘well below 2°C goal’ or Paris ‘1.5°C ambition’ scenarios. We observed that none of those third party
forecasters described their ‘Paris consistent’ scenarios as their ‘base case’, ‘central case’ or ‘most likely’ estimate.
Management notes on page 145 that they consider their ‘best estimate’ prices to be in line with a range of transition paths
consistent with the Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C as well as the ambition to limit global
warming to no greater than 1.5°C. We observed that for bp’s Brent price assumptions, whilst these were within the lower
half of our range of ‘best estimate’ forecasts described above, they were within the higher half of our range of Paris ‘well
below 2°C goal’ and ‘1.5°C ambition’ scenarios. For Henry Hub gas, management’s updated gas price assumptions sit
towards the top of our range until 2040 and then towards the middle until 2050. The positioning of bp’s revised oil and gas
forecasts within the range is broadly consistent with bp’s positioning in the prior period range. We also noted other
reputable third party sources that set out or implied even higher prices under both Paris ‘well below 2°C goal’ and ‘1.5°C
ambition’ scenarios, highlighting the large inherent uncertainty regarding ‘Paris consistent’ pathways and the very wide
range of potential price forecasts. Accordingly, we consider management’s statement as set out above to be reasonable.
By inquiry and analysis, we confirmed that the third party oil and gas price forecasts used to develop our independent
range are on a net producer price basis. Accordingly, we are satisfied management’s judgement is reasonable that the
potential impact of further emission costs being borne by bp is not expected to have a material impact on the group’s oil
and gas CGU carrying values.
We reviewed the disclosures included in Note 1 to the accounts in respect of oil and gas price assumptions, including the
sensitivity analysis presented therein. We observed that management’s downside sensitivity, in which oil and gas prices
are lower than the ‘best estimate’ in all future periods, is close to the bottom end of our range of third party Paris ‘well
below 2°C goal’ and Paris ‘1.5°C ambition’ scenarios for both Brent oil and Henry Hub gas.
Discount rates
bp’s post-tax nominal 8% discount rate used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets, was within the independent
range calculated by our valuation specialists.
We were also satisfied with the calculation of country risk premia. Accordingly, we are satisfied with the discount rates
used in the impairment charge and impairment reversal testing.
Reserves and resources
We assessed the production forecasts used in the oil and gas CGU valuations that we tested to be reasonable and
appropriately risked where applicable, for the purposes of management’s impairment tests. We observed that in
aggregate, management’s production forecasts, as utilised in year-end oil and gas CGU impairment testing, are aligned
with bp’s best estimate of the future production of their existing oil and gas portfolio.

5.3 Decommissioning provisions – Note 1 and 23 to the financial statements
Key audit matter description A decommissioning provision of $11.8 billion is recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2024 (2023 $12.4
billion). The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key
estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation and discount rate assumptions.
Management estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp’s
decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%, which is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%.
The extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ from the general inflation rate depends on
industry demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the time future decommissioning occurs, which in turn
will be influenced by future oil and gas demand, and increasingly by structural changes in the industry supply chain driven
by the energy transition, which are uncertain.
The estimated undiscounted cost of the obligations and the timing of future payments are set out in Note 1 on page 159.
Economic factors, future activities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates,
whereas the timing of decommissioning activities is dependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are
sensitive to changes in bp’s price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of oil and gas reserve
estimates.
bp increased the discount rate used in calculating its decommissioning provisions from 4.0% as at 31 December 2023 to
4.5% as at 31 December 2024. The increase was primarily driven by increased US treasury bond rates.
Additionally, bp is exposed to decommissioning obligations that could revert back to the group in respect of historical
divestments to third parties. Judgement is required to assess the potential risk of reversion and if applicable, the
estimated exposure, for each historically divested asset. The risk of reversion could be elevated by the potential impact of
the energy transition, in particular the potential for lower oil and gas prices in the longer term which could result in financial
resilience concerns for some industry participants.
Provisions for decommissioning refining assets, not generally recognised on the basis that the potential obligations
cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions in demand due
to climate change curtail their operational lives. As disclosed in Note 1 on page 159 management concluded that, although
obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations, they would only be recognised at the point when
sufficient information became available to determine potential settlement dates. Accordingly, other than where a decision
has been made to cease refining operations, no triggers for assessing the need to record a decommissioning provision
have been identified.
This matter was discussed by the Audit Committee on page 85.
How the scope of our audit Long-term inflation rate
responded to the key audit
• We tested the relevant control related to the determination of the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption.
matter
• We tested how management derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption of 1.5%, and the evidence
on which it is based, by gaining an understanding of the process used by management, testing management’s
calculations of the assumption, and evaluating the evidence relevant to management’s assumption, both supporting
and contradictory.
• As the 1.5% decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption is determined by making an adjustment to
management’s 2.0% general long term inflation rate assumption, we evaluated the general long term inflation rate
assumption used of 2.0%, comparing it against latest external market data.
• We made inquiries and evaluated the competence, capability and objectivity of management’s decommissioning
experts who derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate.
• We inspected analyst forecasts and reports in respect of the future decommissioning market and related costs for
evidence of supporting and contradictory evidence, with particular focus on the future rig market.
• We particularly considered the expectation that demand for oil and gas products and related activities will decrease,
primarily in response to climate change and energy transition effects pivoting future energy industry investment and
development activity towards renewable sources. We challenged and evaluated management’s assessment of the
impact this will have on the decommissioning market and the related inflation assumption.
• We analysed historical trends of rig market rates against oil prices and historical inflation to evaluate management’s
assumption that the decommissioning inflation assumption does not inflate at the same rate as general inflation.

Financial statements
Cost and timing estimates
• We tested the relevant controls over the year end decommissioning cost and timing assumptions used within
management’s decommissioning provision estimate.
• We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the assets subject to decommissioning, including understanding the
process to establish whether a legal or constructive obligation existed.
• We evaluated the reasonableness of changes in key cost assumptions including rig rates, vessel rates, well plug and
abandonment duration and non-productive time assumptions, with reference to internal and appropriate third party
data.
• We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates
used for decommissioning estimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment
testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.
• We assessed the accuracy of bp’s disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of
future decommissioning payments.
Discount rates
• We tested the relevant controls related to the determination of the discount rate assumption.
• We assessed the reasonableness of management’s methodology for determining the discount rate and recalculated
the discount rate with reference to independent third party data, most notably US treasury bond yields.
Reversion risk
• We obtained an understanding of bp’s decommissioning reversion risk assessment process and tested relevant
internal controls including those controls over the completeness and accuracy of the previously divested asset data.
• We challenged and evaluated management’s key judgements related to the decommissioning reversion risk and
conclusions as to whether any additional provision should be recognised, or specific contingent liability disclosure
made. We assessed the relevant internal and external evidence used in forming this judgement, including the financial
health of the counterparty or counterparties in the ownership chain for the divested assets and the existence of any
other pertinent factors which could indicate a higher probability of decommissioning obligations reverting to bp.
Potential decommissioning of refinery assets
• We challenged and evaluated management’s analysis which supported the judgement that no decommissioning
provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no
current intention to cease these activities.
• We have reviewed analysis undertaken by management, as well as third-party studies, of forecast demand for refined
products in regions served by bp’s refineries. Furthermore, we read external profitability benchmarking to assess the
conclusion that the group’s remaining refineries would likely remain operational for longer than many of their regional
competitors, in the event of refining capacity reductions.
• We also met with refinery management to understand the potential plans under consideration for refineries in the
future and obtained evidence that management is developing plans for the existing refinery sites remaining in the
portfolio which would be compatible with net zero emissions, for instance through the production of alternative low
carbon and sustainable fuels.
Key observations We concluded that the assumed inflation rate of 1.5% remains reasonable as a long-term inflation rate for
decommissioning liabilities. With respect to the extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ
from the general inflation rate, which is influenced by the demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the
time future decommissioning occurs, we concluded that market forecasts support the assertion that demand for rigs will
not increase in the long term as a result of the impact of the energy transition and therefore that inflation of rig costs will
be limited.
We concluded that the cost and timing assumptions used in the decommissioning provision calculation were reasonable
and the assumptions are appropriately supported by industry data. The disclosure included on page 159 with respect to
the estimated undiscounted cost of bp’s decommissioning obligations and the timing of future decommissioning
payments are consistent with these conclusions.
Based on our audit procedures, we consider bp’s 4.5% discount rate to be reasonable.
No material additional decommissioning provisions have been made in respect of historical divestments where bp are
exposed to decommissioning reversion risk as a result of the potential future bankruptcy of the current asset owner.
Based on our review and challenge of management’s assessment, we consider this judgement to be reasonable. We also
consider the contingent liability disclosure to be reasonable.
In respect of the group’s refining assets, taking into consideration both the IEA demand forecasts and management’s
strategic plans for the group’s refineries, including developing production of low carbon and sustainable fuels, we are
satisfied that it is not currently possible for management to determine closure dates for the remaining operational
refineries or estimate reliably a settlement date for any decommissioning obligations prior to a decision being made to
cease refining operations. Accordingly, we have not identified any triggers that would require a decommissioning provision
to be recorded.

5.4 Valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition – Notes 1, 29 and 30 to the
financial statements
Key audit matter description bp’s supply, trading and shipping (ST&S) function is responsible for globally trading and risk managing the group’s owned
as well as third party production. To discharge this responsibility, ST&S regularly executes commodity contracts,
physically settled or otherwise, which are accounted for as a derivative and fair valued under IFRS 9. These contracts,
therefore, result in unrealised gains/losses that are recognised on account of fair value movements in the associated
derivative assets and liabilities.
Determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly where the
valuation is dependent on significant inputs which are not observable and are classified as level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy set out in IFRS 13. This degree of subjectivity also makes such fair value estimates liable to potential fraud by
management incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements, sensitivity
to management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we have identified a significant risk
in respect of certain financial instruments where the valuation is dependent on significant unobservable inputs.
Fair value measurements associated with unrealised commodity contracts are also impacted by the macroeconomic
sentiment and outlook. In 2024, commodity markets continued to experience periods of volatility due to continuing
uncertainty resulting from the planned energy transition, macro-economic factors such as inflation and interest rates, and
disruptions in global supply due to geopolitical conflicts. In response to the volatility observed, we focused our audit
efforts on the valuation of commodity derivatives and designed procedures to test for management bias.
As at 31 December 2024, the group’s total level 3 derivative financial assets were $16.0 billion (2023 $9.2 billion) and level
3 derivative financial liabilities were $14.4 billion (2023 $7.1 billion).
This matter was discussed by the Audit Committee on page 85.
How the scope of our audit In response to the above, we analysed the population of these instruments to assess the level of unobservability of the
responded to the key audit inputs used in their valuation and then further disaggregated the population into different risk populations which in turn
matter drove the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.
To address the complexities associated with auditing the valuation of instruments dependent on significant unobservable
inputs, we included valuation specialists with significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our
audit procedures. Our valuation audit work included the following control and substantive procedures:
• We tested the group’s valuation relevant controls including:
– the model certification control, which is designed to review a model’s theoretical soundness and the
appropriateness of its valuation methodology; and
– the independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs
that are not observable and are significant to the financial instrument’s valuation.
• We performed valuation testing procedures at interim and year-end balance sheet dates, including:
– evaluating management’s valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a
consistent framework is applied across the business period over period;
– engaging our valuation specialists to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and evaluate consistency
in management’s modelling and input assumptions throughout the year;
– comparing management’s input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants
and observable market data;
– independently validating price points on pricing curves; and
– analysing whether there was any indication of management bias through evaluating the distribution of valuation
differences where relevant.
Key observations Based on the evaluation of the results of the procedures noted above, we concluded that management’s valuations
relating to commodity derivatives were appropriate and we did not identify evidence of management bias in the valuation
estimates or accounting entries that we tested.

Financial statements
5.5 Management override of controls (potentially impacting all financial statement accounts)
Key audit matter description We conducted an assessment of the fraud risks arising from management override of controls by considering potential
areas where the group’s financial statements could be manipulated. In performing this assessment, we considered
pressures or incentives to achieve certain measures due to the remuneration arrangements of people in Financial
Reporting Oversight Roles (FRORs), including management and senior executives, as well as other incentives which could
exist in light of bp’s share buyback commitments communicated to its shareholders.
Our considerations included the potential for:
• inappropriate accounting estimates and judgements
• the posting of fictitious or fraudulent journal entries or
• inappropriate accounting for significant transactions that are outside the normal course of business for the entity.
Management has enhanced its control environment in 2024 to address deficiencies identified during prior period audits.
During the year, certain deficiencies had yet to be remediated but we have identified mitigating controls to address the risk
associated with the deficiencies. These included analytical reviews, controls over closing balances, period-end analytical
review controls and certain automated business controls.
This area had a significant bearing again this year on the allocation of audit resources and has been discussed with the
audit committee throughout the year. Accordingly, we identified this as a key audit matter.
How the scope of our We tested the mitigating controls to respond to the risk of fraudulent journal entries. In addition, we:
audit responded to the
• made inquiries of individuals with different levels of responsibility involved in the financial reporting process about
key audit matter
inappropriate or unusual activity relating to the processing of journal entries and other adjustments;
• identified and tested relevant entity-level controls, in particular those related to the bp Code of Conduct, whistleblowing
(bp OpenTalk) and controls monitoring financial reporting processes and financial results;
• made inquiries of management and others within bp as appropriate, who deal with allegations, if any, of fraud raised by
employees or other parties;
• used our data analytics tools to select journal entries and other adjustments made at the end of a reporting period, or
otherwise having characteristics associated with common fraud schemes, for testing; and
• tested journal entries and other adjustments recorded in the general ledger throughout the period, with a particular
focus on adjustments that occur late in the financial close process.
We assessed accounting estimates for bias. A number of the most significant estimates are covered by the other key
audit matters set out above. This assessment included:
• evaluating whether the judgements and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included
in the financial statements, even if they are individually reasonable, indicate a possible bias on the part of bp's
management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud; and
• performing a retrospective analysis of management judgements and assumptions related to significant accounting
estimates reflected in the financial statements of the prior year.
We considered whether there were any significant transactions that are outside the normal course of business, or that
otherwise appear to be unusual due to their nature, timing or size.
The risks and responses to the revenue recognition risk within the supply, trading and shipping function are set out on
page 126.
Key observations We were able to rely on the mitigating controls tested.
Our testing of journal entries and other adjustments, selected through the use of our data analytics tools, did not identify
any inappropriate items.
We did not identify evidence of overall bias or any significant transactions that are outside the normal course of business
for which the business rationale (or the lack thereof) of the transaction suggested that it may have been entered into to
engage in fraudulent financial reporting or to conceal misappropriation of assets.

6. Our application of materiality
6.1 Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably
knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our
work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality In 2024 we set materiality for both the group and parent company at $800 million.
In 2023, we used a materiality of $1,000 million for both the group and parent company. The decrease in materiality is due to
the downturn in the group’s performance compared with prior year.
Basis for determining Changing macroeconomic conditions, one-off transactions We determined materiality for our audit of the standalone
materiality and strategic decisions had a significant impact on the parent using 0.6% (2023 0.8%) of net assets.
group’s profit before tax in 2024. We therefore determined
that it is appropriate to use the benchmarks of most
relevance to investors, being cash flow from operations and
underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.
Materiality was determined to be $800 million, which is 2.9%
of cash flow from operations (2023 3.1%) and 3.9% of
underlying replacement cost profit before tax (2023 3.7%). In
2023, we determined materiality to be $1,000 million, which
represented 4.2% of profit before tax and 3.7% of underlying
replacement cost profit before tax.
Rationale for the We conducted an assessment of which line items are the The materiality determined for the standalone parent
benchmark applied most important to investors and analysts by reading analyst company is based on net assets as the company is non-
reports and bp's communications to shareholders and trading and operates primarily as a holding company. We
lenders, as well as the communications of peer companies. believe the net asset position is the most appropriate
benchmark to use.
Based on our review of analysts’ reports, all analysts
identified one or more cashflow metrics as a key operating
metric, particularly net cash flow from operations. Also,
based on our assessment of the latest results announcement
Q&As, the focus of the investors has been on cash flow
generation and the strength of the balance sheet, particularly
from a net debt perspective given the current underlying
performance of the group. We therefore focused on cash
flow from operations in our determination of materiality for
the current year.
We further note that the alternative performance measure
underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax is
one of the key metrics communicated by management in
bp's results announcements and therefore is considered to
be an appropriate benchmark.

6.2 Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements
exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Performance materiality Group and parent company performance materiality was set at 65% of materiality for the 2024 audit (2023 65% of
materiality).
Basis and rationale for Consistent with the prior year, performance materiality of 65% reflects the overall quality of the control environment, the
determining performance magnitude of misstatements identified in the current and prior years, as well as the fact that management is generally willing
materiality to correct any such misstatements.
6.3 Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of $40 million (2023 $50 million), as well as
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
7. An overview of the scope of our audit
7.1 Identification and scoping of components
As a result of the highly disaggregated nature of the group, with operations in over 60 countries through approximately 940 cons units, a significant portion
of our audit planning effort was so that the scope of our work was appropriate in addressing the identified risks of material misstatement.
The factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the bp audit, and the level of work to be performed included the following:
• The determination of significance of an account balance and risks of material misstatement related to it, history of unusual or complex transactions,
identification of significant audit issues or the potential for, or a history of, material misstatements.
• The effectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including entity-level controls.
• The findings, observations and audit differences that we noted as a result of our 2023 audit engagement.
Our audit approach was generally to place reliance on management’s controls over financial reporting.

bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 129

--- PAGE 132 ---
For the current year, components have either been subject to audits of one or more classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures, or specific
further audit procedures.
As a result, to be able to obtain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence for the purposes of our audit of the financial statements, the group engagement team
and component teams performed audits of specified account balances in 153 reporting cons units covering UK, US, Australia, Azerbaijan, Germany,
Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal, Indonesia, Egypt, India and Abu Dhabi.
In 2023, we performed full scope audits for 138 reporting cons units which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. Our full-scope audits
were in the UK, US, Australia, Azerbaijan and Germany. In addition, component teams performed audit procedures on specified account balances in 24
cons units also covering Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal, Indonesia, Egypt, India and Abu Dhabi.
The group engagement team performed audit procedures on specified account balances to component materiality, with certain additional specific
procedures performed by component teams, covering an additional 25 cons units (2023 27).
The remaining cons units are not significant individually and include many small, low risk components and balances. On average, they each represent
0.04% of revenue (2023 0.04%), 0.04% of property, plant and equipment (2023 0.03%) and 0.04% of profit before tax (2023 0.04%).
In our assessment of the residual balances not covered by the above procedures, we have considered the risk that there could be undetected and
uncorrected misstatements that are material in the aggregate within the large number of geographically dispersed businesses, in particular within the C&P
segment. This assessment included use of our analytic tools to interrogate data, preparation of trend analysis and comparison of business performance to
market benchmark prices. We also tested management's group-wide controls across a range of locations and segments. We concluded that through this
additional risk assessment, we have reduced the audit risk of such misstatements arising to a sufficiently low level.
Our audit coverage of ‘Property, plant and equipment’, ‘Revenue’ and ‘Profit before tax’ is materially the same as in the prior year.

Audit of specific account balances Audit of specific account balances Audit of specific account balances
Specified audit procedures Specified audit procedures Specified audit procedures
Review at group level Review at group level Review at group level
7.2 Our consideration of the control environment
Our audit approach was generally to place reliance on management’s relevant controls over all business cycles affecting in scope financial statement line
items. We tested a sample of these controls through a combination of tests of inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance.
In limited situations where we were not able to take a controls reliance approach due to controls being deficient and there not being sufficient mitigating or
alternative controls we could rely on instead, we adopted a non-controls reliance approach. All control deficiencies which we considered to be significant
were communicated to the audit committee. All other deficiencies were communicated to management. For all deficiencies identified we considered the
impact and updated our audit plan accordingly.
The group’s financial systems environment is complex, with 101 separate IT systems scoped as being relevant to the audit for the following key locations
(UK, US, Germany, Azerbaijan and Australia) as well as other minor locations. These systems are all directly or indirectly relevant to the entity’s financial
reporting process.
We planned to rely on the General IT Controls (‘GITCs’) associated with these systems, and having tested controls over access security, change
management, data centre operations and network operations, were able to do so.
7.3 Working with other auditors
The group audit team is responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and providing direct oversight, review, and coordination of our
component audit teams. We interacted regularly with the component Deloitte teams during each stage of the audit and reviewed key working papers. We
maintained continuous and open dialogue with our component teams in addition to holding formal meetings quarterly to ensure that we were fully aware
of their progress and results of their procedures.
Consistent with prior year, the senior statutory auditor and other group audit partners and staff conducted visits to meet with the component teams
responsible for the audits of specified account balances during the year. These visits included attending planning meetings, discussing the audit approach
including the risk assessments and any issues arising from the component team's work, meetings with local management, and reviewing key audit
working papers on higher and significant-risk areas to drive a consistent and high-quality audit. In addition, a global audit planning meeting was held in
London for three days in July led by the senior statutory auditor and involving the group audit team, partners and staff from all full scope component
teams, audit teams responsible for testing at key Global Business Services (GBS) locations and senior management from bp.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this
gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
9. Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to
liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined
above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting
irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.
11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we
considered the following:
• our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Ethics and Compliance and reviews of bp’s internal ethics and compliance reporting
summaries, including those concerning investigations;
• enquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the group’s
policies and procedures relating to:
– identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;
– detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and
– the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;
• review of the terms of reference of the Fraud Governance Board set up by management to support the creation and delivery of the Group Fraud Risk
Strategy, periodically monitor the threat outlook and review the risk appetite;
• review of the Fraud Governance Board’s meeting minutes and its fraud risk assessment;
• the group’s remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels; and
• discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.
The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as bp operates,
and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved fraud specialists who advised the
engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries, and they participated in the initial fraud risk assessment
discussions.

bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 131

--- PAGE 134 ---
In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.
We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and
regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we
considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, UK Corporate Governance Code, US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and relevant SEC
regulations, as well as laws and regulations prevailing in each country in which we identified a full-scope component.
In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which
may be fundamental to the group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group’s operating licences and environmental
regulations.
11.2 Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We
did identify two key audit matters relating to fraud risks, as described above, being the valuation of commodity financial derivatives, and management
override of controls. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we
performed in response to those key audit matters.
In addition to the above, procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:
• reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and
regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;
• enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
• obtaining confirmations from external legal counsel concerning open litigation and claims;
• performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; and
• reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC and the IRS.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists
and component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• The information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial statements.
• The strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have
not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
13. Corporate Governance Statement
The Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance
Statement relating to the group’s compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is
materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:
• the directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties
identified set out on page 113
• the directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the group’s prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out
on page 113
• the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 113
• the board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 112
• the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 112 and
• the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on pages 82-85.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the shareholders and board of directors of BP p.l.c.
Opinion on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated group balance sheets of BP p.l.c. and subsidiaries (together ‘bp’ or ‘the group’) as at 31 December 2024
and 2023, the related consolidated group income statements, group statements of comprehensive income, group statements of changes in equity and
group cash flow statements, for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
‘financial statements’). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as at 31 December
2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2024, in accordance with
United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU).
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), bp's internal control
over financial reporting as of 31 December 2024, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management,
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting and our report dated 6 March 2025
expressed an unqualified opinion on bp's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of bp’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on bp’s financial statements based on
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to bp in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on
the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical
audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
1. Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets – Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The group balance sheet as at 31 December 2024 includes PP&E, of which $56 billion is oil and gas properties.
Management’s best estimate oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised in 2024 as set out in Note 1 on page 152,
although the revisions were not significant.
Management have also determined bp’s ‘best estimate’ discount rate assumptions, as set out in Note 1 on page 152. Bp’s post-tax discount rate used for
impairment testing for oil and gas assets in 2024 remained unchanged from prior year at 8%. Pre-tax discount rates applied in impairment tests were
revised in some regions to reflect changes in local tax rates and country risk premiums. Reserves estimates for all oil and gas fields were also reviewed
and updated where necessary at year-end.
Management judged that in aggregate, the year-end oil and gas price assumption revisions, changes to pre-tax discount rates for certain regions due to
country risk premium or tax rate changes and changes to other input assumptions including reserves reductions on several key fields, all combined to
constitute an impairment trigger for all oil and gas cash generating units (CGUs). As a result of testing performed during 2024, $2.0 billion of oil and gas
CGU net impairment charges were recognised, principally due to certain discount rate revisions, an increase in certain capital expenditure forecasts and
operating expenditure forecasts and certain reserves write downs.
We identified three key management estimates in management’s determination of the level of impairment charge and/or impairment reversal. These are:
Oil and gas prices – bp’s oil and gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment assessments performed across the
OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change,
the global energy transition, macro-economic factors and disruption in global supply due to ongoing geo-political conflicts. There is a risk that
management do not forecast reasonable ‘best estimate’ oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for impairment charge and/or impairment
reversal, leading to material misstatements. These price assumptions are highly judgmental and are pervasive inputs to bp’s oil and gas CGU
valuation. There is also a risk that management’s oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.
Discount rates – Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Discount
rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management
does not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements.
Determining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also a
pervasive input across bp’s oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates.
Reserves and resources estimates – A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas production forecast, which is based on
underlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource
volumes, in addition to proven and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these
volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable production forecasts for
individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp’s reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and
G&LCE segments.

Financial statements
We identified certain individual CGUs which we determined would be most at risk of material impairment charges as a result of a reasonably possible
change in the oil and gas price assumptions. This population includes previously impaired assets which are also at risk of material impairment reversal
resulting from potential oil and gas price assumption changes. We identified that a subset of these CGUs was also individually materially sensitive to the
discount rate assumption.
We also identified CGUs which were less sensitive as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a reasonably possible
change in some or all of the key assumptions.
Impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a critical audit matter because recoverable
values are reliant on forecast assumptions such as oil and gas prices, discount rates and reserves estimates, which are inherently judgemental, complex
for management to estimate and challenging to audit. Additionally, the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk remains material to the group.
How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit
We tested relevant internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates, and reserve and resources estimates, as well as relevant
internal controls over the performance of the impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we
conducted the following substantive procedures.
Oil and gas prices
• We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management’s oil and gas
price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.
• In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.
• In challenging and evaluating management’s price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios
obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition.
• The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of ‘holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above
pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’ was reaffirmed at CoP 29 in Baku during
November 2024. We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris ‘well
below 2°C goal’ and/or ‘1.5°C ambition’ and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.
• We assessed management’s disclosures in Note 1, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how
climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than
currently anticipated in bp’s value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.
Discount rates
• We independently evaluated bp’s discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists, against relevant third party market
and peer data.
• When performing procedures over specific assets, we assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp’s
discount rates.
• We challenged and evaluated management’s disclosures in Note 1, including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.
Reserves and resources estimates
With the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:
• assessed bp’s reserves and resources estimation methods and policies for reasonableness;
• assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp’s reserves and resources estimates;
• read and evaluated a sample of reports provided by management’s external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these
third parties;
• assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of bp’s internal and external reserve experts, through understanding their relevant professional
qualifications and experience;
• assessed whether management’s production forecasts are consistent overall with bp’s strategy;
• compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management’s approved reserves and resources estimates; and
• performed a retrospective assessment in order to assess management's ability to accurately estimate reserves and resources and to check for
indications of estimation bias over time.
2. Decommissioning provisions – Notes 1 and 23 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
A decommissioning provision of $11.8 billion is recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2024. The estimation of decommissioning
provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation
and discount rate assumptions.
Management estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp’s decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%,
which is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%.
The estimated undiscounted cost of the obligations and the timing of future payments are set out in Note 1 on page 159. Economic factors, future
activities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates, whereas the timing of decommissioning activities is
dependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are sensitive to changes in bp’s price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of
oil and gas reserve estimates.
bp increased the discount rate used in calculating its decommissioning provisions from 4.0% as at 31 December 2023 to 4.5% as at 31 December 2024.
The increase was primarily driven by increased US treasury bond rates.

How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit
Long term Inflation rate
• We tested the relevant control related to the determination of the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption.
• We tested how management derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption of 1.5%, and the evidence on which it is based, by gaining
an understanding of the process used by management, testing management’s calculations of the assumption, and evaluating the evidence relevant to
management’s assumption, both supporting and contradictory.
• As the 1.5% decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption is determined by making an adjustment to management’s 2.0% general long term
inflation rate assumption, we evaluated the general long term inflation rate assumption used of 2.0%, comparing it against latest external market data.
• We made inquiries and evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity, of management’s decommissioning experts who derived the
decommissioning specific inflation rate.
• We inspected analyst forecasts and reports in respect of the future decommissioning market and related costs for evidence of supporting and
contradictory evidence, with particular focus on the future rig market.
• We particularly considered the expectation that demand for oil and gas products and related activities will decrease, primarily in response to climate
change and energy transition effects pivoting future energy industry investment and development activity towards renewable sources. We challenged
and evaluated management’s assessment of the impact this will have on the decommissioning market and related inflation assumption.
• We analysed historical trends of rig market rates against oil prices and historical inflation to evaluate management’s assumption that the
decommissioning inflation assumption does not inflate at the same rate as general inflation.
Cost and timing estimates
• We tested the relevant controls over the year end decommissioning cost and timing assumptions used within management’s decommissioning
provision estimate.
• We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the assets subject to decommissioning, including understanding the process to establish whether a
legal or constructive obligation existed.
• We evaluated the reasonableness of changes in key cost assumptions, including rig rates, vessel rates, well plug and abandonment duration, and non-
productive time assumptions, with reference to internal and appropriate third-party data.
• We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates used for decommissioning
estimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.
• We assessed the accuracy of bp’s disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future decommissioning
payments.
Discount rates
• We tested the relevant controls related to the determination of the discount rate assumption.
• We assessed the reasonableness of management’s methodology for determining the discount rate and recalculated the discount rate with reference to
independent third party data, most notably US treasury bond yields.

3. Valuation of commodity financial derivatives - Notes 1, 29 and 30 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
bp’s supply, trading and shipping (ST&S) function is responsible for globally trading and risk managing the group’s owned as well as third party production.
To discharge this responsibility, ST&S regularly executes commodity contracts, physically settled or otherwise, which are accounted for as a derivative and
fair valued under IFRS 9. These contracts, therefore, result in unrealised gains/losses that are recognised on account of fair value movements in the
associated derivative assets and liabilities.
Determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly where the valuation is dependent on significant
inputs which are not observable and are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS 13. This degree of subjectivity also makes such fair
value estimates liable to potential fraud by management incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements,
sensitivity to management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we have identified a risk in respect of certain financial
instruments where the valuation is dependent on significant unobservable inputs.
Fair value measurements associated with unrealised commodity contracts are also impacted by the macroeconomic sentiment and outlook. In 2024,
commodity markets continued to experience periods of volatility due to continuing uncertainty resulting from the planned energy transition, macro-
economic factors such as inflation and interest rates, and disruptions in global supply due to geopolitical conflicts. In response to the volatility observed,
we focused our audit efforts on the valuation of commodity derivatives and designed procedures to test for management bias.
As at 31 December 2024, the group’s total level 3 derivative financial assets were $16.0 billion and level 3 derivative financial liabilities were $14.4 billion.
How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit
To address the complexities associated with auditing the valuation of instruments dependent on significant unobservable inputs, we included valuation
specialists with significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our audit procedures. Our valuation audit work included the
following control and substantive procedures:
• We tested the group’s valuation relevant controls including:
– the model certification control, which is designed to review a model’s theoretical soundness and the appropriateness of its valuation methodology;
and
– the independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs that are not observable and are
significant to the financial instrument’s valuation.
• We performed valuation testing procedures including:
– evaluating management’s valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a consistent framework is applied
across the business period over period;
– engaging our valuation specialists to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and evaluate consistency in management’s modelling and input
assumptions throughout the year;
– comparing management’s input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants and observable market data;
– independently validating price points on pricing curves to consensus data; and
– analysing whether there was any indication of management bias through evaluating the distribution of valuation differences where relevant.

4. Impairment of E&A assets and refinery PP&E as a consequence, among other things, of climate change and the energy transition –
Notes 1, 4, 8 and 15 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Intangible Assets
The recoverability of certain of the group’s $4.4 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024 is potentially
exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors (see Note 15). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed
as a consequence of the energy transition, or lower forecast future oil and gas prices. The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be written
off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex and continues to require significant management judgement.
PP&E
The carrying value of bp’s refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and demand which arise among other
things as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Management identified impairment indicators in respect of the Gelsenkirchen
refinery in Germany during the year and, as a result, an impairment test was performed to assess the recoverability of the Gelsenkirchen refinery carrying
value. As disclosed in Note 4 to the accounts on page 166, management has recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 billion in respect of the Gelsenkirchen
refinery, primarily driven by changes in economic assumptions. At 31 December 2024 management identified an impairment indicator for all of its other
refineries due to a reduction in the local marker margins. The impairment tests performed by management to assess the recoverability of the carrying
value of these refineries did not result in any additional impairment charges being recognised.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Intangible Assets
In respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2024:
• We tested the relevant controls within the group’s E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes; and
• We challenged and evaluated management’s key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6. Where impairment indicators were
identified we corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing
evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management’s key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting
minutes and assessing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or
modify key terms.
PP&E
We considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group’s refining portfolio and assessed internal and external market studies
of future supply and demand. In relation to refinery impairment tests performed by management, our audit procedures included:
• Evaluating the valuation methodology and testing the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment models;
• Assessing the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs to the impairment models, notably forecast refining margins, discount rate and energy
input costs, challenging and evaluating management’s assumptions by reference to third party data where available and involvement of our valuation
specialists; and
• Evaluating management’s ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results with historical forecasts and tested
management’s internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the shareholders and board of directors of BP p.l.c.
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries (the group) as of 31 December 2024, based on the criteria
established in the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting relating
to internal control over financial reporting (UK FRC Guidance). In our opinion, the group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of 31 December 2024, based on the criteria established in the UK FRC Guidance.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated
financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024, of the group and our report dated 6 March 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those financial statements.
As described in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over
financial reporting at bp bioenergy (formerly called Bunge Bioenergia) and Lightsource bp which were acquired on 1 October 2024, and 24 October 2024,
respectively. bp bioenergy financial statement line items comprise 2.1% and 0.9% of net and total assets respectively, 0.3% of sales and other operating
revenues, and (4.5)% of profit (loss) for the year of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2024.
Lightsource bp’s financial statement line items comprise 6.3% and 2.4% of net and total assets respectively, 0.1% of sales and other operating revenues,
and (5.7)% of profit (loss) for the year of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2024. Accordingly, our
audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at bp bioenergy and Lightsource bp.
Basis for opinion
The Group’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes on financial statements
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions
Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
The consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as bp or the group) were approved and signed by the chief
executive officer and chairman on 6 March 2025 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. BP p.l.c. is a public limited company
incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted
international accounting standards and IFRS Accounting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as
adopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under
international accounting standards. IFRS as adopted by the UK does not differ from IFRS as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the UK and EU differs
in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the group’s consolidated financial statements for the years
presented. The material accounting policy information and accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions of the group are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRSs and IFRS Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2024. The accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all
years presented, except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where
otherwise indicated.
Material accounting policy information: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions
Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements is the need for bp management to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting
judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with
the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.
The areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for the
investments in Rosneft and Aker BP; exploration and appraisal intangible assets; the recoverability of asset carrying values, including the estimation of
reserves; supplier financing arrangements; derivative financial instruments; provisions and contingencies; pensions and other post-employment benefits;
and taxation. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and geopolitical
environment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the consolidated financial statements are also set out in boxed text
below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.
Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy
Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These may have
significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the group’s assets and liabilities discussed below and on similar assets and liabilities that may
be recognized in the future. The group’s assumptions for investment appraisal (see page 20) form part of an investment decision-making framework for
currently unsanctioned future capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment, and intangibles including exploration and appraisal assets, that is
designed to support the effective and resilient implementation of bp’s strategy. The price assumptions used for investment appraisal include oil and gas
price assumptions, which are producer prices and are therefore net of any future carbon prices that the purchaser may be required to pay, and an
assumption of a single carbon emissions cost imposed on the producer in respect of operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and
methane) in order to incentivize engineering solutions to mitigate GHG emissions on projects. The group's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use
impairment testing are aligned with those investment appraisal assumptions. The assumptions for future carbon emissions costs in value-in-use
impairment testing differ from the investment appraisal assumptions and are described below.
Management has also not identified any off-balance sheet commodity purchase obligations to be onerous contracts as result of the transition to a lower
carbon economy at 31 December 2024.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill
The energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of
property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management’s best estimate of oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-
use impairment testing were revised during 2024. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real 2023 terms and are materially consistent with
the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints
before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will
cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that
declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. The revised assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas sit within the range of
external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate
change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit
the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
As noted above, the group’s investment appraisal process includes a carbon emissions price series for the investment economics which is applied to
bp's anticipated share of bp's forecast of the investment assets' scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions where they exceed defined thresholds, and is assumed to
apply whether or not bp is the asset operator. However, for value-in-use impairment testing on bp's existing cash generating units (CGUs), consistent with
all other relevant cash flows estimated, bp is required to reflect management's best estimate of any expected applicable carbon emission costs payable
by bp, including where bp is not the operator, in the future for each jurisdiction in which the group has interests. This requires management’s best
estimate of how future changes to relevant carbon emission cost policies and/or legislation are likely to affect the future cash flows of the group’s
applicable CGUs, whether currently enacted or not. Future potential carbon pricing and/or costs of carbon emissions allowances are included in the
value-in-use calculations to the extent management has sufficient information to make such an estimate. Currently this results in limited application of
carbon price assumptions in value-in-use impairment tests given that carbon pricing legislation in most impacted jurisdictions where the group has
interests is not in place and there is not sufficient information available as to the relevant policy makers' future intentions regarding carbon pricing to
support an estimate. A key input into the determination of impairment is the assumption, aligned with bp’s aim to reach net zero greenhouse gas
emissions by 2050 or sooner, that the current recognized portfolio of oil and gas properties and refining assets will have an immaterial carrying value by
2050.
Where we consider that the outcome of a value-in-use impairment test could be significantly affected by a carbon price in place in any jurisdiction, this is
incorporated into the value-in use impairment testing cash flows. The most significant instances where a carbon price has been incorporated in the 2024
value-in-use impairment tests is for the UK North Sea and the Gelsenkirchen refinery. The assumptions for UK North Sea were £59/tCOe in 2025
2
gradually increasing to £231/tCOe in 2050. The assumption applied for the Gelsenkirchen refinery was an average of approximately $97/tCOe.
2 2
However, as bp’s forecast future prices are producer prices, the group considers it reasonable to assume that if, in addition to the costs already in place,
further scope 1 and 2 emission costs were partially to be borne directly by oil and gas producers including bp in future and the prevalence of such costs
were to become widespread, the gross oil and gas prices realized by producers would be correspondingly higher over the long term, resulting in no
expected overall materially negative impacts on the group’s net cash flows. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying
values for further information including sensitivity analysis in relation to reasonably possible changes in the price assumptions and carbon costs.
Production assumptions within upstream property, plant and equipment and goodwill value-in-use impairment tests reflect management’s current best
estimate of future production of the existing upstream portfolio. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and
Note 14 for sensitivity analyses in relation to reasonably possible changes in production for upstream oil and gas properties and goodwill respectively.
For the customers & products segment, though the energy transition may impact demand for certain refined products in the future, management
anticipates sufficiently robust demand for the remainder of each refinery’s useful life.
Management will continue to review price assumptions as the energy transition progresses and this may result in impairment charges or reversals in the
future.
Exploration and appraisal intangible assets
The energy transition may affect the future development or viability of exploration prospects. The recoverability of the group's exploration and appraisal
intangible assets was considered during 2024. No significant write-offs were identified. These assets will continue to be assessed as the energy
transition progresses. See significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets and Note 8 for further information.
Property, plant and equipment – depreciation and expected useful lives
The energy transition may curtail the expected useful lives of oil and gas industry assets thereby accelerating depreciation charges. However, a
significant majority of bp’s existing upstream oil and natural gas properties are likely to have immaterial carrying values within the next 12 years and, as
outlined in bp's strategy, oil and natural gas production will remain an important part of bp’s business activities over that period. The significant majority
of refining assets, recognized on the group’s balance sheet at 31 December 2024 that are subject to depreciation, will be depreciated within the next 12
years; demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient to support the remaining useful lives of existing assets. Therefore, management does
not expect the useful lives of bp’s reported property, plant and equipment to change and do not consider this to be a significant accounting judgement or
estimate. Significant capital expenditure is still required for ongoing projects as well as renewal and/or replacement of aged assets and therefore the
useful lives of future capital expenditure may be different. See material accounting policy: property, plant and equipment for more information.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Provisions: decommissioning
The energy transition may bring forward the decommissioning of oil and gas industry assets thereby increasing the present value of associated
decommissioning provisions. The majority of bp’s existing upstream oil and gas properties are expected to start decommissioning within the next two
decades. Currently, the expected timing of decommissioning expenditures for the upstream oil and gas assets in the group’s portfolio has not materially
been brought forward. Management does not expect a reasonably possible change of two years in the expected timing of all decommissioning to have a
material effect on the upstream decommissioning provisions, assuming cost assumptions remain unchanged.
Decommissioning cost estimates are based on the known regulatory and external environment. These cost estimates may change in the future, including
as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy. For refineries, decommissioning provisions are generally not recognized as the associated
obligations have indeterminate settlement dates, typically driven by the cessation of manufacturing. Management does not expect manufacturing to
cease at refineries within a determinate period of time, as existing property, plant and equipment is expected to be renewed or replaced. Management will
continue to review facts and circumstances, including where cessation of manufacturing decisions have been made, to assess if decommissioning
provisions need to be recognized. Decommissioning provisions relating to refineries at 31 December 2024 are not material. See significant judgements
and estimates: provisions for further information.
Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards
to the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment.
Oil and gas price assumptions
Oil and gas price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing have been updated for inflation and have been rebased in real 2023 terms. See
significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information.
Discount rate assumptions
The discount rates used for impairment testing and provisions were reassessed during the year in light of changing economic and geopolitical outlooks.
The nominal discount rate applied to provisions was increased during the year to reflect higher US Treasury yields. The principal impact of this rate
increase was a $0.9 billion decrease in the decommissioning provision with an associated decrease in the carrying amount of property, plant and
equipment of $0.7 billion and a pre-tax credit to the income statement of $0.2 billion. The post-tax impairment discount rate applicable to assets other
than renewable power assets remained consistent with 2023 as did the risk premium applied to the majority of countries classified as higher-risk. See
significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions for further information.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The volatility in the financial markets during 2024 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of
defined benefit obligations in the group’s defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits and Note
24 for further information.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are
consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, including when control is obtained via potential voting
rights, and continue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. Intra-group
balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated unless
the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within non-
controlling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by subsidiaries and for which the group has the unconditional right to avoid
transferring cash or another financial asset to the holders. Profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders is adjusted to reflect the coupon/interest related to
these hybrid securities whether or not such distribution has been deferred.
Interests in other entities
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair
values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest and
the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
at the acquisition date. The amount recognized for any non-controlling interest is measured at the present ownership's proportionate share in the
recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating
units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost
less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 January 2003 is stated at the previous carrying amount
under UK generally accepted accounting practice, less subsequent impairments.
Goodwill may arise upon investments in joint ventures and associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the group’s share of the net fair
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Any such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment in joint ventures and associates.
Goodwill may also arise upon acquisition of interests in joint operations that meet the definition of a business. The amount of goodwill separately
recognized is the excess of the consideration transferred over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Interests in joint arrangements
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as
described below.
Certain of the group’s activities, particularly in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, are conducted through joint
operations. bp recognizes, on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint
operations incurred jointly with the other partners, along with the group’s revenue from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses
that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation.
For joint arrangements in a separate entity, judgement may be required as to whether the arrangement should be classified as a joint venture or if the legal
form, contractual arrangements or other facts and circumstances indicate that the group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the
arrangement, rather than rights to the net assets, and therefore should be classified as a joint operation. No such judgement made by the group is
considered significant.
Interests in associates
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as
described below.
Significant judgement: investment in Aker BP
Judgement is required in assessing the level of control or influence over another entity in which the group holds an interest. For bp, the judgement that
the group has significant influence over Aker BP, a Norwegian oil and gas company, is significant.
As a consequence of this judgement, bp uses the equity method of accounting for its investment and bp's share of Aker BP's oil and natural gas reserves
is included in the group's estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities. If significant influence was not present, the investment would be
accounted for as an investment in an equity instrument measured at fair value as described under 'Financial assets' below and no share of Aker BP's oil
and natural gas reserves would be reported.
Significant influence is defined in IFRS as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint
control of those decisions. Significant influence is presumed when an entity owns 20% or more of the voting power of the investee. Significant influence
is presumed not to be present when an entity owns less than 20% of the voting power of the investee.
bp owned 15.9% of the voting shares at 31 December 2024. bp’s senior vice president North Sea, Doris Reiter, was appointed a member of the Aker BP
board during 2024. bp’s other nominated director, group chief financial officer, Kate Thomson, has been a member of the Aker BP board since formation
of that company in 2016. She is also a member of the Aker BP board’s Audit and Risk Committee. bp also holds the voting rights at general meetings of
shareholders conferred by its stake in Aker BP. bp's management considers, therefore, that the group continues to have significant influence at 31
December 2024.
Significant judgements and estimate: investment in Rosneft
Since the first quarter 2022, bp accounts for its interest in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, as financial assets measured at
fair value within ‘Other investments’. bp is not able to sell its Rosneft shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange and is unable to ascribe probabilities to
possible outcomes of any exit process. It is considered by management that any measure of fair value, other than nil, would be subject to such high
measurement uncertainty, considering the sanctions and restrictions implemented by Russia on Russian assets held by foreign investors, that no
estimate would provide useful information even if it were accompanied by a description of the estimate made in producing it and an explanation of the
uncertainties that affect the estimate. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to estimate any carrying value other than zero when determining the
measurement of the interest in Rosneft and the other businesses with Rosneft within Russia as at 31 December 2024. Events or outcomes within the
next financial year, that are different to those outlined above, could materially change the fair value of the investment.
Russia has imposed restrictions on the payments of dividends to certain foreign shareholders, including those based in the UK, requiring such dividends
to be paid in roubles into restricted bank accounts and a requirement for approval of the Russian government for transfers from any such bank accounts
out of Russia. Given the restrictions applicable to such accounts, management has made the significant judgement that the criteria for recognizing any
dividend income from Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, for the years to 31 December 2022, 31 December 2023 and 31
December 2024 have not been met.
The equity method of accounting
Under the equity method, an investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of net assets of the
entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Loans advanced to equity-accounted entities that have the
characteristics of equity financing are also included in the investment on the group balance sheet. The group income statement reflects the group’s share
of the results after tax of the equity-accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment of the equity-accounted
entity’s assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The group statement of comprehensive income includes the group’s share of the equity-
accounted entity’s other comprehensive income. The group’s share of amounts recognized directly in equity by an equity-accounted entity is recognized in
the group’s statement of changes in equity.
Financial statements of equity-accounted entities are typically prepared for the same reporting year as the group. Where material differences arise in the
accounting policies used by the equity-accounted entity and those used by bp, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the accounting
policies used into line with those of the group. Unrealized gains on transactions, apart from those that meet the definition of a derivative, between the
group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the equity-accounted entity. This includes unrealized gains
arising on contribution of a business on formation of an equity-accounted entity.

Segmental reporting
The group’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the group that are evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer,
bp’s chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group’s accounting policies described in this note, except that IFRS requires that
the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker. For bp,
this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is
arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized
measure under IFRS.
For further information see Note 5.
Foreign currency translation
In individual subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities
at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the
functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement, unless
hedge accounting is applied. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.
In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and related
goodwill, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional
currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange. In the consolidated financial
statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other
comprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term intra-group foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group’s non-US dollar
investments are also reported in other comprehensive income if the borrowings form part of the net investment in the subsidiary, joint venture or
associate. On disposal or for certain partial disposals of a non-US dollar functional currency subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the related accumulated
exchange gains and losses recognized in equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Significant non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for
immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to
the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and
actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be
withdrawn.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized, and equity accounting of associates and joint ventures is ceased
once classified as held for sale.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, biogas rights agreements,
digital assets, patents, licences and trademarks and are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated
impairment losses.
Intangible assets are carried initially at cost unless acquired as part of a business combination. Any such asset is measured at fair value at the date of the
business combination and is recognized separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets with a finite life, other than capitalized exploration and appraisal costs as described below, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their expected useful lives. For patents, licences and trademarks, expected useful life is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic
useful life, and can range from three to fifteen years. The expected useful life of biogas rights agreements is the shorter of the duration of the legal
agreement and economic useful life and can be up to 50 years. Digital asset costs generally have a useful life of three to five years.
The expected useful lives of assets and the amortization method are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the
amortization method are accounted for prospectively.
Oil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure
Oil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure is accounted for using the principles of the successful efforts method of accounting as described
below.
Licence and property acquisition costs
Exploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm
that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under
way or planned or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical
and commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned, the
remaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off. Lower value licences are pooled and amortized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated period of exploration. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves of oil and natural
gas, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.
Exploration and appraisal expenditure
Geological and geophysical exploration costs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially
capitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration,
materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors. If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration
well costs are written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs
continue to be carried as an asset. If it is determined that development will not occur, that is, the efforts are not successful, then the costs are expensed.

Costs directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the
initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset.
Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property,
plant and equipment. If development is not approved and no further activity is expected to occur, then the costs are expensed.
The determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is usually made within one
year of well completion, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic
quantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure (e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before
production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration or
appraisal work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as such work is under way or firmly planned.
Significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets
Judgement is required to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to carry costs associated with exploration wells and exploratory-type
stratigraphic test wells on the balance sheet. This includes costs relating to exploration licences or leasehold property acquisitions. It is not unusual to
have such costs remaining suspended on the balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and
natural gas field is performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are established. The costs are carried based on the current regulatory
and political environment or any known changes to that environment. All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial and
management review on at least an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery. Where this is
no longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.
The carrying amount of capitalized costs are included in Note 8.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment owned by the group is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of
an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if applicable, and, for
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, directly attributable general or specific finance costs. The
purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Expenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs.
Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item
will flow to the group, the expenditure is capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced asset is derecognized. Inspection costs associated with major
maintenance programmes are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next inspection. Overhaul costs for major maintenance programmes, and
all other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Expenditure on the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells,
including service and unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated from the
commencement of production.
Oil and natural gas properties, including certain related pipelines, are depreciated using a unit-of-production method. The cost of producing wells is
amortized over proved developed reserves. Licence acquisition, common facilities and future decommissioning costs are amortized over total proved
reserves. The unit-of-production rate for the depreciation of common facilities takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated
future capital expenditure expected to be incurred relating to as yet undeveloped reserves expected to be processed through these common facilities.
Information on the carrying amounts of the group’s oil and natural gas properties, together with the amounts recognized in the income statement as
depreciation, depletion and amortization is contained in Note 12 and Note 5 respectively.
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves determined in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including the
application of prices using 12-month historical price data in assessing the commerciality of technical volumes, are typically used to calculate depreciation,
depletion and amortization charges for the group’s oil and gas properties. Therefore, where this approach is adopted, charges are not dependent on
management forecasts of future oil and gas prices.
The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected
future production.
The estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and bp’s process to manage reserves bookings is described in Supplementary information on oil and natural
gas on page 223, which is unaudited. Details on bp’s proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes are provided on page 322.
The 2024 movements in proved reserves are reflected in the tables showing movements in oil and natural gas reserves by region in Supplementary
information on oil and natural gas (unaudited) on page 223.
Other property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life. The typical useful lives of the group’s other
property, plant and equipment on initial recognition are as follows:
Land improvements 15 to 25 years
Buildings 20 to 50 years
Refineries 20 to 30 years
Pipelines 10 to 50 years
Service stations 15 years
Office equipment 3 to 10 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 to 15 years

Financial statements
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
The expected useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful
lives or the depreciation method are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no
future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the period in which the item
is derecognized.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and equity-accounted entities
The group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs), for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable; for example, changes in the group’s business plans, plans to dispose rather
than retain assets, changes in the group’s assumptions about discount rates, commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for
oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning
costs. If any such indication of impairment exists, the group makes an estimate of the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. Individual assets are grouped
into CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash
inflows of other groups of assets. A CGU’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If it is probable that
the value of the CGU will be primarily recovered through a disposal transaction, the expected disposal proceeds are considered in determining the
recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount.
The business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination
of value in use. They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, power generation, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of
refined products (e.g. gasoline and lubricants), revenues, costs and capital expenditure. Carbon taxes and costs of emissions allowances are included in
estimates of future cash flows, where applicable, based on the regulatory environment in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. As an initial step in
the preparation of these plans, various assumptions regarding market conditions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, power prices, refining margins,
refined product margins and cost inflation rates are set by senior management. These assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand
equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group to the extent that they are not already reflected in the discount rate and are discounted to their
present value typically using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Fair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not
reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the group and not applicable to entities in general. Fair value may be determined by reference to
agreed or expected sales proceeds, recent market transactions for similar assets or using discounted cash flow analyses. Where discounted cash flow
analyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing
the asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or
may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is
the case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit
or loss. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s or CGU's revised carrying amount, less any residual
value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of
CGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to
which goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is less than the carrying
amount (including goodwill), an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
The group assesses investments in equity-accounted entities for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired, after
recognizing its share of any losses of the equity-accounted entity itself. If any such objective evidence of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the
investment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If the carrying amount
exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.
Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values
Determination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on
highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where
applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-
demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, power and refined products. Judgement is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets
into a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes. For example, individual oil and gas properties may form separate CGUs
whilst certain oil and gas properties with shared infrastructure may be grouped together to form a single CGU. Alternative groupings of assets or CGUs
may result in a different outcome from impairment testing. See Note 14 for details on how these groupings have been determined in relation to the
impairment testing of goodwill.
As described above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of
disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data.
Details of impairment charges and reversals recognized in the income statement are provided in Note 4 and details on the carrying amounts of assets
are shown in Note 12, Note 14 and Note 15.
The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2024 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. Changes in
the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these
assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.

Discount rates
For discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted
using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a
market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax
discount rate.
The discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2024, the post-tax discount rate was 8% (2023 8%) other than for
renewable power assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk, an additional premium of 1% to 3% was reflected in the
post-tax discount rate (2023 1% to 4%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various
economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for renewable power assets, typically ranged from 9% to 20% (2023 9% to 20%)
depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For renewable power assets, which were tested primarily
on a fair-value basis in 2024 (including those in equity accounted entities) tests were performed using a post-tax cost of equity-based discount rate range
of 8.75% to 9.5%. In 2023, tests were performed on a value-in-use basis using a post-tax WACC-based discount rate of 6.5%.
Oil and natural gas properties
For oil and natural gas properties in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, expected future cash flows are estimated
using management’s best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, production and reserves and certain resources volumes. Forecast cash flows
include the impact of all approved emission reduction projects. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions
about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors.
In 2024, the group identified oil and gas properties in these segments with carrying amounts totalling $17,853 million (2023 $18,374 million) where the
headroom, based on the most recent impairment test performed in the year on those assets, was less than or equal to 20% of the carrying value. A
change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one
or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period.
Management considers that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices
and/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year, see Sensitivity analyses, below.
The recoverability of intangible exploration and appraisal expenditure is covered under Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development
expenditure above.
Oil and natural gas prices
The price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp’s carbon emissions cost
assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate
change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 145. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice
president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy
transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon
supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the
scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.
During the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing were revised. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real
2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per
barrel to reflect near term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy
system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00
per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. These price assumptions are derived
from the central case investment appraisal assumptions (see page 20). A summary of the group’s revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub
gas, applied in 2024 and 2023, in real 2023 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management’s best estimate of future prices at the
balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line
with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. Inflation rate of 2% - 2.5% (2023 2%) is applied to determine the price
assumptions in nominal terms.
The majority of bp’s reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the group’s existing oil and gas properties are expected to be produced
over the next 12 years.
The recoverability of deferred tax assets is also affected by the group’s oil and natural gas price assumptions as these could impact the estimate of
future taxable profits. See Note 9 for further information.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Global oil production increased by 1.4% in 2024 with this growth predominantly coming from non-OPEC countries as OPEC+ continued its output
reductions. Global oil demand growth slowed, increasing by 0.9% in 2024 as we leave the post-Covid recovery period and Chinese demand fell short of
forecasts. Brent dropped by nearly $2 per barrel in 2024 in response to lacklustre demand growth and increasing supply. While geopolitical risk (e.g.,
tariffs, sanctions) may support prices in the short-term, bp's long-term assumption for oil prices is lower than the 2024 average as oil demand is likely to
fall such that the price levels needed to encourage sufficient investment to meet global oil demand will also be lower.
US Henry Hub spot prices averaged $2.2/mmBtu in 2024 from $2.5/mmBtu in 2023. Prices fell further in order to reduce output and stimulate demand in
the power sector. Milder than normal winter weather during winter 2023/2024 left US gas storage levels over 20% above historic average levels at the end
of winter 2023/2024, causing prices to fall below $2/mmBtu. Meanwhile, after growing by 4 Bcf/d in 2023, low prices caused natural gas production to
fall by 0.4 Bcf/d in 2024, helping to bring the market back into balance. The level of US gas prices in 2024 was below bp’s long term price assumption
based on the judgment of the price level required to incentivize new production.
Oil and natural gas reserves
In addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the group’s estimated oil and
natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data,
reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the group’s estimates of its oil
and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial
assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.
Reserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of
oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to
reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.
Sensitivity analyses
Management considers discount rates, oil and natural gas prices and production to be the key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining the
recoverable amount of upstream oil and gas assets. The sensitivity analyses below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also
indicate how the energy transition, potential future carbon emissions costs for operational GHG emissions and/or reduced demand for oil and gas may
further impact forecast revenue cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group’s value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs, if
carbon emissions costs were to be implemented as a deduction against revenue cash flows. The analyses therefore represent a net revenue sensitivity.
A change in net revenue from upstream oil and gas properties can arise either due to changes in oil and natural gas prices, carbon emissions costs/
carbon prices, changes in oil and natural gas production, or a combination of these.
Management tested the impact of changes in net revenue cash flows in value-in-use impairment testing under the following sensitivity analyses: an
increase in net revenues of 8% in all years up to 2040, and 25% in all remaining years to 2050; and a decrease in net revenues of 20% in all years up to
2030, 35% in all subsequent years to 2040 and 50% in all remaining years to 2050.
Net revenue reductions of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp’s currently held upstream oil and
gas properties in the range of $19-20 billion which is approximately 30% of the associated net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31
December 2024. If this net revenue reduction was due to reductions in prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative decrease in the carrying amount of using
price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the bottom of the range of prices associated with the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD) 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
This ‘family’ of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario analysis (see page 42).
Net revenue increases of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to an increase in the carrying amount of bp’s currently held upstream oil and
gas properties in the range of $1-2 billion which is approximately 2-3% of the associated net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31
December 2024. This potential increase in the carrying amount would arise due to reversals of previously recognized impairments and represents
approximately one fifth of the total impairment reversal capacity available at 31 December 2024. If this net revenue increase was due to increases in
prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative increase in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the top end
until 2040, and then towards the mean average at 2050, of the range of prices associated with the WBCSD 'family' of scenarios considered to be
consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This ‘family’ of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario
analysis.
These sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management’s best estimate of any impairment charges or reversals that might be recognized as
they do not fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and phasing of development. For
example, costs across the industry are more likely to decrease as oil and natural gas prices fall. The analyses also assume the impact of increases in
carbon price on operational GHG emissions are fully absorbed as a decrease in net revenue (and vice versa) rather than reflecting how carbon prices or
other carbon emissions costs may ultimately be incorporated by the market. The above sensitivity analyses therefore do not reflect a linear relationship
between net revenue and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and factors plus the diverse characteristics of the group's
upstream oil and gas properties limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall recoverable amount is impacted by
changes to the price assumptions or production volumes.
Management also tested the impact of a one percentage point change in the discount rate used for value-in-use impairment testing of upstream oil and
gas properties. This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year. If the discount
rate was one percentage point higher across all tests performed, the net impairment loss recognized in 2024 would have been approximately $0.2 billion
higher. If the discount rate was one percentage point lower, the net impairment loss recognized would have been approximately $0.5 billion lower.

Management considers refining margins to be the key source of estimation uncertainty in determining the recoverable amount of refinery assets. The
sensitivity analysis below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also indicates how the energy transition and/or reduced
demand for refined products may further impact forecast cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group’s value-in-use estimates
for refinery CGUs.
Management tested the impact of a $1/barrel decrease in each refinery’s future margin assumption in all years of the value-in-use estimate. A reduction
of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp’s currently held refining property, plant and equipment in
the range of $1-2 billion.
This sensitivity analysis does not, however, represent management’s best estimate of any impairment charges that might be recognized as it does not
fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and crude or product slates. The above sensitivity
analysis therefore does not reflect a linear relationship between margins and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and
factors plus the varying configurations of the group's refineries limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall
recoverable amount is impacted by changes to the margin assumptions.
Goodwill
Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, bp is required to test annually for impairment of goodwill acquired in business
combinations. The group carries goodwill of $14.9 billion on its balance sheet (2023 $12.5 billion), principally relating to the Atlantic Richfield, Burmah
Castrol, Devon Energy, Reliance and Lightsource bp transactions. Of this, $7.2 billion relates to goodwill in the oil production & operations segment and to
hydrocarbon CGUs within the gas & low carbon energy segment (2023 $7.0 billion), for which oil and gas price and production assumptions are key
sources of estimation uncertainty. Sensitivities and additional information relating to impairment testing of goodwill in these segments are provided in
Note 14.
Inventories
Inventories, other than inventories held for short-term trading purposes, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is typically determined
by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses. Net realizable value
is determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date, adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence
about their net realizable value at the end of the period.
Inventories held for short-term trading purposes are stated at fair value less costs to sell and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income
statement.
Supplies are valued at the lower of cost on a weighted-average basis and net realizable value.
Leases
Agreements that convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration are accounted for as leases.
The right to control is conveyed if bp has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and the right to direct the use of, the
identified asset throughout the period of use. An asset is identified if it is explicitly or implicitly specified by the agreement and any substitution rights held
by the lessor over the asset are not considered substantive.
Agreements that convey the right to control the use of an intangible asset including rights to explore for or use hydrocarbons are not accounted for as
leases. See material accounting policy information: intangible assets.
A lease liability is recognized on the balance sheet on the lease commencement date at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term.
The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable, otherwise an incremental borrowing rate is used. For the majority of the
leases in the group, there is not sufficient information available to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing
rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on factors such as the group’s cost of borrowing, lessee legal entity credit risk, currency
and lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease together with any periods covered by an extension option that bp is reasonably
certain to exercise, or periods covered by a termination option that bp is reasonably certain not to exercise. The future lease payments included in the
present value calculation are any fixed payments, payments that vary depending on an index or rate, payments due for the reasonably certain exercise of
options and expected residual value guarantee payments. Repayments of principal are presented as financing cash flows and payments of interest are
presented as operating cash flows.
Payments that vary based on factors other than an index or a rate such as usage, sales volumes or revenues are not included in the present value
calculation and are recognized in the income statement and presented as operating cash flows. The lease liability is recognized on an amortized cost basis
with interest expense recognized in the income statement over the lease term, except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development
expenditure.
The right-of-use asset is recognized on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at a value equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease
liability adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives, initial direct costs and any restoration obligations. The right-of-use asset is depreciated typically
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation charge is recognized in the income statement except for where capitalized as exploration,
appraisal or development expenditure. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment in line with the accounting policy for impairment of property, plant
and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.
Agreements may include both lease and non-lease components. Payments for lease and non-lease components are allocated on a relative stand-alone
selling price basis except for leases of retail service stations where the group has elected not to separate non-lease payments from the calculation of the
lease liability and right-of-use asset.
If the lease term at commencement of the agreement is less than 12 months, a lease liability and right-of-use asset are not recognized, and a lease
expense is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis.

If a significant event or change in circumstances, within the control of bp, arises that affects the reasonably certain lease term or there are changes to the
lease payments, the present value of the lease liability is remeasured using the revised term and payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by an
equivalent amount.
Modifications to a lease agreement beyond the original terms and conditions are accounted for as a re-measurement of the lease liability with a
corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Any gain or loss on modification is recognized in the income statement. Modifications that increase
the scope of the lease at a price commensurate with the stand-alone selling price are accounted for as a separate new lease.
The group recognizes the full lease liability, rather than its working interest share, for leases entered into on behalf of a joint operation if the group has the
primary responsibility for making the lease payments. This may be the case if for example bp, as operator of the joint operation, is the sole signatory to the
lease agreement. In such cases, bp’s working interest share of the right-of-use asset is recognized if it is jointly controlled by the group and the other joint
operators, and a receivable is recognized for the share of the asset transferred to the other joint operators. If bp is a non-operator, a payable to the operator
is recognized if they have the primary responsibility for making the lease payments and bp has joint control over the right-of-use asset, otherwise no
balances are recognized.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as
set out below. The group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been
transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and rewards
of the asset have neither been retained nor transferred but control of the asset has been transferred. This includes the derecognition of receivables for
which discounting arrangements are entered into.
The group classifies its financial asset debt instruments as measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value
through profit or loss. The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of
the financial asset.
Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash
flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective
interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired
and when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.
Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Financial assets are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they are held in a business model the objective of
which is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and
interest.
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss when the asset does not meet the criteria to be measured at amortized cost
or fair value through other comprehensive income. Such assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income
statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.
Investments in equity instruments
Investments in equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss unless an election is made on an instrument-by-
instrument basis to recognize fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses
arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the
date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value
through profit or loss.
Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost
The group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets measured at amortized cost at each balance
sheet date. Expected credit losses are measured based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. As lifetime
expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the tenor of substantially all other in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is
no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses for the group. The measurement of expected credit
losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows the group expects to receive discounted at the financial asset’s original effective
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is adjusted, with the amount of the impairment gain or loss recognized in the income statement.
A financial asset or group of financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost is considered to be credit-impaired if there is reasonable and
supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or group of
financial assets) have occurred. Financial assets are written off where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering amounts due.
Equity instruments
Instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that
cannot be settled in the group’s own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange
financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity that are potentially unfavourable are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the group
are recognized at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.

Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognized when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognizes financial
liabilities when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their
classification, as follows:
Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities are carried on
the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging
instruments, are included in this category.
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses
arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
All other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this
is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is
calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or
cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.
This category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.
Significant judgement: supplier financing arrangements
The group’s trade payables include some supplier financing arrangements that utilize letter of credit facilities, promissory notes and reverse factoring.
Judgement is required to assess the payables subject to these arrangements to determine whether they should continue to be classified as trade
payables and give rise to operating cash flows or finance debt and financing cash flows. The criteria used in making this assessment include the
payment terms for the amount due relative to terms commonly seen in the markets in which bp operates and whether the arrangements significantly
change the nature of the liability. Liabilities subject to these arrangements with payment terms of up to approximately 60 days are generally considered
to be trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows. See Note 29 - Liquidity risk for further information.
Financial guarantees
The group issues financial guarantee contracts to make specified payments to reimburse holders for losses incurred if certain associates, joint ventures or
third-party entities fail to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument such as a loan. The liability for a
financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract’s estimated expected credit loss
and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices, as well as for trading purposes. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which a
derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item (for example, oil, oil products, gas or power) that can be settled net in cash, with the exception of contracts
that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the group’s expected
purchase, sale or usage requirements, are accounted for as financial instruments. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that
are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement.
If, at inception of a contract, the valuation cannot be supported by observable market data, any gain or loss determined by the valuation methodology is
not recognized in the income statement but is deferred on the balance sheet and is commonly known as a ‘day-one gain or loss’. This deferred gain or loss
is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all the remaining contractual cash flows can be valued using
observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Changes in valuation subsequent to the
initial valuation at inception of a contract are recognized immediately in the income statement.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
• Fair value hedges when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.
• Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or
liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Hedge relationships are formally designated and documented at inception, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the
hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, the
existence at inception of an economic relationship and subsequent measurement of the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to
changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the hedge ratio and sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Hedges
meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:
Fair value hedges
The change in fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being
hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss, where it offsets. The group applies fair value
hedge accounting when hedging interest rate risk and certain currency risks on fixed rate finance debt.
Fair value hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when
the risk management objective changes or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised. The accumulated adjustment to the carrying
amount of a hedged item at such time is then amortized prospectively to profit or loss as finance interest expense over the hedged item's remaining period
to maturity.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedging instrument is reported in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is
recognized in profit or loss. Amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction
affects profit or loss.
Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, such as a forecast
foreign currency transaction for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognized within other comprehensive income are
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. Where the hedged item is an equity investment, the amounts recognized in
other comprehensive income remain in the separate component of equity until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss or when accounting under the
equity method is discontinued. Where the hedged item is recognized directly in profit or loss, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are
reclassified to production and manufacturing expenses or sales and other operating revenues as appropriate.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when
the designated hedged forecast transaction or part thereof is no longer considered to be highly probable to occur, or when the hedging instrument is sold,
terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover. When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued amounts previously recognized within other
comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to the initial carrying
amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized within other
comprehensive income will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.
Costs of hedging
The foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from hedge designations and accounted for as costs of hedging.
Changes in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread are recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that they relate to the hedged item.
For time-period related hedged items, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is amortized to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the
term of the hedging relationship.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The group
categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement.
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant
modifications to observable related market data or bp’s assumptions about pricing by market participants.
Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments
In some cases the fair values of derivatives are estimated using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices or other observable, market-
corroborated data. This primarily applies to the group’s longer-term derivative contracts. The majority of these contracts are valued using models with
inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from available active market pricing data (including volatility and
correlation) and modelled using the maximum available external information. Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are
determined using historical and long-term pricing relationships. The use of alternative assumptions or valuation methodologies may result in significantly
different values for these derivatives. A reasonably possible change in the price assumptions used in the models relating to index price would not have a
material impact on net assets and the Group income statement primarily as a result of offsetting movements between derivative assets and liabilities.
In some cases, judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell commodities meet the definition of a derivative or to determine
appropriate presentation and classification of transactions in certain cases. In particular, contracts to buy and sell LNG are not considered to meet the
definition as they are not considered capable of being net settled due to a lack of liquidity in the LNG market and the inability or lack of history of net
settlement and are accounted for on an accruals basis, rather than as a derivative. Under IFRS, bp fair values the derivative financial instruments used to
risk-manage the LNG contracts themselves, resulting in a measurement mismatch.
For more information, including the carrying amounts of level 3 derivatives, see Note 30.
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the balance sheet unless both of the following criteria are met: the group currently has a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. A right of set off is the group’s legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the
same counterparty. The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties are considered when assessing whether a
current legally enforceable right to set off exists.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where appropriate, the future cash flow estimates are adjusted to reflect risks specific to the liability.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is
recognized within finance costs. Provisions are discounted using a nominal discount rate of 4.5% (2023 4%).
Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled
later (non-current).
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the group, or present
obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient
reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed, if material, unless the possibility of an outflow
of economic resources is considered remote.

Decommissioning
Liabilities for decommissioning costs are recognized when the group has an obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility or an
item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Where an obligation exists for a new
facility or item of plant, such as oil and natural gas production or transportation facilities, this liability will be recognized on construction or installation.
Similarly, where an obligation exists for a well, this liability is recognized when it is drilled. An obligation for decommissioning may also crystallize during
the period of operation of a well, facility or item of plant through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations; an obligation may
also arise in cases where an asset has been sold but the subsequent owner is no longer able to fulfil its decommissioning obligations, for example due to
bankruptcy. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and
requirements. The provision for the costs of decommissioning wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives is estimated
using existing technology, at future prices, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a nominal discount rate.
An amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is recognized as part of the corresponding intangible asset (in the case of an exploration or
appraisal well) or property, plant and equipment. The decommissioning portion of the property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated at the
same rate as the rest of the asset. Other than the unwinding of discount on or utilization of the provision, any change in the present value of the estimated
expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset where that asset is generating or is expected to generate future
economic benefits.
Environmental expenditures and liabilities
Environmental expenditures that are required in order for the group to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those
assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed.
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognized when a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. Generally, the timing of
recognition of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions for environmental liabilities have been
estimated using existing technology, at future prices and discounted using a nominal discount rate.
Emissions
Liabilities for emissions are recognized when the cumulative volumes of gases emitted by the group at the end of the reporting period exceed the
allowances granted free of charge held for own use or a set baseline for emissions. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. It is based on the excess of actual emissions over the free allowances held or set
baseline in tonnes (or other appropriate quantity) and is valued at the actual cost of any allowances that have been purchased and held for own use on a
first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, and, if insufficient allowances are held, for the remaining requirement on the basis of the spot market price of allowances at
the balance sheet date. The majority of these provisions are typically settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date however certain schemes may
have longer compliance periods. The cost of allowances purchased to cover a shortfall is recognized separately on the balance sheet as an intangible
asset unless the emission allowances acquired or generated by the group are risk-managed by the trading and shipping function, then they are recognized
on the balance sheet as inventory.
Restructuring provisions
Restructuring provisions are recognized where a detailed formal plan exists, and a valid expectation of risk of redundancy has been made to those affected
but where the specific outcomes remain uncertain. Where formal redundancy offers have been made, the obligations for those amounts are reported as
payables and, if not, as provisions if unpaid at the year-end.

Significant judgements and estimates: provisions
The group holds provisions for the future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives.
The largest decommissioning obligations facing bp relate to the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal and disposal of oil and natural gas
platforms and pipelines around the world. Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will
have to be met when the removal event occurs are uncertain. Decommissioning technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are political,
environmental, safety and public expectations. The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty and estimation is
required in determining the amounts of provisions to be recognized. Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and,
where still recognized, the asset.
If oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties, judgement is required to assess whether the new owner will be unable to
meet their decommissioning obligations, whether bp would then be responsible for decommissioning, and if so the extent of that responsibility. This
typically requires assessment of the local legal requirements and the financial standing of the owner. If the standing deteriorates significantly, for
example, bankruptcy of the owner, a provision may be required. The group has $0.7 billion of decommissioning provisions recognized as at 31 December
2024 (2023 $0.6 billion) for assets previously sold to third parties where the sale transferred the decommissioning obligation to the new owner. See Note
33 for further information.
Decommissioning provisions associated with refineries are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, given their
indeterminate settlement dates. Obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations and any such obligations would be recognized in the
period when sufficient information becomes available to determine potential settlement dates. See Note 33 for further information.
The group performs periodic reviews of its refineries for any changes in facts and circumstances including those relating to the energy transition, that
might require the recognition of a decommissioning provision. Portfolio strength and flexibility are such that the point of cessation of manufacturing at
the group’s operating refineries is not yet expected within a determinate time period, as existing property plant and equipment is expected to be renewed
or replaced.
The provision for environmental liabilities is estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology, price levels and expected plans
for remediation. Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from current estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations,
prices, discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean-up technology.
The timing and amount of future expenditures relating to decommissioning and environmental liabilities are reviewed annually. The interest rate used in
discounting the cash flows is reviewed quarterly. The nominal interest rate used to determine the balance sheet obligations at the end of 2024 was 4.5%
(2023 4%), which was based on long-dated US government bonds interpolated to reflect the expected weighted average time to decommissioning. The
weighted average period over which decommissioning and environmental costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately
17 years (2023 17 years) and 7 years (2023 6 years) respectively. Costs at future prices are typically determined by applying an inflation rate of 1.5%
(2023 1.5%) to decommissioning costs and 2% (2023 2%) for all other provisions. A lower rate is typically applied to decommissioning as certain costs
are expected to remain fixed at current or past prices.
The estimated phasing of undiscounted cash flows in real terms for upstream decommissioning is approximately $5.5 billion (2023 $5.5 billion) within
the next 10 years, $6.2 billion (2023 $5.8 billion) in 10 to 20 years and the remainder of approximately $6.7 billion (2023 $6.6 billion) after 20 years. The
timing and amount of decommissioning cash flows are inherently uncertain and therefore the phasing is management’s current best estimate but may
not be what will ultimately occur.
Further information about the group’s provisions is provided in Note 23. Changes in assumptions in relation to the group's provisions could result in a
material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the nominal discount rate applied could
decrease the group’s provision balances by approximately $1.5 billion (2023 $1.6 billion). The pre-tax impact on the group income statement would be a
credit of approximately $0.4 billion (2023 $0.4 billion). This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within
the next financial year.
The discounting impact on the group's decommissioning provisions for oil and gas properties in the oil productions & operations and gas & low carbon
energy segments of a two-year change in the timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures is approximately $0.3 billion (2023 $0.6 billion).
Management currently does not consider a change of greater than two years to be reasonably possible in the next financial year and therefore the timing
of upstream decommissioning expenditure is not a key source of estimation uncertainty.
If all expected future decommissioning expenditures were 10% higher, then these decommissioning provisions would increase by approximately $1.2
billion (2023 $1.1 billion) and a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.4 billion (2023 $0.2 billion) would be recognized. A one percentage point increase in
the inflation rate applied to upstream decommissioning costs to determine the nominal cash flows could increase the decommissioning provision by
approximately $1.7 billion (2023 $1.9 billion) with a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.5 billion (2023 $0.5 billion).
As described in Note 33, the group is subject to claims and actions for which no provisions have been recognized. The facts and circumstances relating
to particular cases are evaluated regularly in determining whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised. Accordingly,
significant management judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are
rendered by employees of the group. Deferred bonus arrangements that have a vesting date more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are valued
on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period until the award vests. The
material accounting policy information for pensions and other post-employment benefits are described below.
bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 159

--- PAGE 162 ---
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The cost of providing benefits under the group’s defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which
attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value
of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result
of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.
Net interest expense relating to pensions and other post-employment benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in
present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the
present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected
changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.
Remeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts
included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently
reclassified to profit and loss.
The defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of
the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations
are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit
pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions
to the plan.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Significant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits
Accounting for defined benefit pensions and other post-employment benefits involves making significant estimates when measuring the group's pension
plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.
Pensions and other post-employment benefit assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to
determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the group's balance sheet and pension and
other post-employment benefit expense for the following year.
The assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these
variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and
net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying
amounts of the group's pension and other post-employment benefit obligations within the next financial year. Any differences between these
assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.
The values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation
used are provided in Note 24.
Income taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined
in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except:
• Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill.
• Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of
the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and
deductible temporary differences.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the
group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused
tax losses can be utilized, except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and,
at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductive temporary differences.
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax
assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable or increased to
the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.

Financial statements
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled,
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not
discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different
taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities
simultaneously.
Where tax treatments are uncertain, if it is considered probable that a taxation authority will accept the group's proposed tax treatment, income taxes are
recognized consistent with the group's income tax filings. If it is not considered probable, the uncertainty is reflected within the carrying amount of the
applicable tax asset or liability using either the most likely amount or an expected value, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the
uncertainty.
The computation of the group’s income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions
throughout the world. The resolution of tax positions taken by the group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take
several years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. Therefore, judgement is required to determine whether
provisions for income taxes are required and, if so, estimation is required of the amounts that could be payable.
In addition, the group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit.
However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or
tax credits can be utilized. Management judgement is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the
amount of future taxable profits that will be available. Such judgements are inherently impacted by estimates affecting future taxable profits such as oil
and natural gas prices and decommissioning expenditure, see 'Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and
provisions'.
In July 2023, the UK government enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model rules. The legislation is effective for bp from 1 January 2024 and
includes an income inclusion rule and a domestic minimum tax, which together are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each
country in which the group operates. Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. In line with the amendments to IAS 12,
the exception from recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes has been applied.
In October 2024, the UK government announced changes (effective from 1 November 2024) to the Energy Profits Levy including a 3% increase in the rate
taking the headline rate of tax on North Sea profits to 78%, an extension to the period of application of the Levy to 31 March 2030 and the removal of the
Levy’s main investment allowance. The changes to the rate and to the investment allowance were substantively enacted in 2024 and have been applied in
accounting for current tax and deferred tax in the year, resulting in an additional non-cash deferred tax charge of approximately $0.1 billion. The extension
of the Levy to 31 March 2030 was substantively enacted after 31 December 2024 and will result in a non-cash deferred tax charge of around $0.5 billion in
the year ended 31 December 2025.
Significant judgement and estimate: taxation
The value of deferred tax assets and liabilities is an area involving inherent uncertainty and estimation and balances are therefore subject to risk of
material change as a result of underlying assumptions and judgements used, in particular the forecast of future profitability used to determine the
recoverability of deferred tax, for example future oil and gas prices, see ‘Significant judgement and estimates - Recoverability of asset carrying values’. It
is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of profitability assumptions on the group’s deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management’s estimates, material income tax charges or credits, and material changes in current and
deferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise within the next financial year and in future periods.
Judgement is required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax (for example, a production tax). The attributes of
the tax, including whether it is calculated on profits or another measure such as production or revenues, the extent of deductibility of costs and the
interaction with existing income taxes, are considered in determining the classification of the tax. Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes
as described above but is not applied to other types of taxes; rather such taxes are recognized in the income statement in accordance with the applicable
accounting policy such as Provisions and contingencies.
This judgement is considered significant only in relation to the group’s taxes payable under the fiscal terms of bp’s onshore concession in Abu Dhabi.
These are principally reported as income taxes rather than as production taxes.
For more information see Note 9 and Note 33.
Customs duties and sales taxes
Customs duties and sales taxes that are passed on or charged to customers are excluded from revenues and expenses. Assets and liabilities are
recognized net of the amount of customs duties or sales tax except:
• Customs duties or sales taxes incurred on the purchase of goods and services which are not recoverable from the taxation authority are recognized as
part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.
• Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of customs duty or sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included within receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Own equity instruments – treasury shares
The group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders’ equity. Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased
and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to meet the future
requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the
consolidated financial statements as treasury shares. The cost of treasury shares subsequently sold or reissued is calculated on a weighted-average
basis. Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares. Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not
shown as treasury shares. Instead, the nominal amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve and any difference to the purchase price is shown
as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve in the group statement of changes in equity.

Revenue and other income
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when or as the group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good
or service to a customer. The transfer of control of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG, petroleum and chemical products, and other items usually
coincides with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession. The group principally satisfies its performance obligations at a
point in time; the amounts of revenue recognized relating to performance obligations satisfied over time are not significant.
When, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that
performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the group expects to be entitled. The transaction price is allocated
to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling prices of the goods or services promised.
Contracts for the sale of commodities are typically priced by reference to quoted prices. Revenue from term commodity contracts is recognized based on
the contractual pricing provisions for each delivery. Certain of these contracts have pricing terms based on prices at a point in time after delivery has been
made. Revenue from such contracts is initially recognized based on relevant prices at the time of delivery and subsequently adjusted as appropriate. All
revenue from these contracts, both that recognized at the time of delivery and that from post-delivery price adjustments, is disclosed as revenue from
contracts with customers.
Sales and purchase of commodities accounted for under IFRS 15 are presented on a gross basis in Revenue from contracts with customers and
Purchases respectively. Physically settled derivatives which represent trading or optimization activities are presented net alongside financially settled
derivative contracts in Other operating revenues within Sales and other operating income. Certain physically settled sale and purchase derivative contracts
which are not part of trading and optimization activities are presented gross within Other operating revenues and Purchases respectively. Changes in the
fair value of derivative assets and liabilities prior to physical delivery are also classified as other operating revenues.
Physical exchanges with counterparties in the same line of business in order to facilitate sales to customers are reported net, as are sales and purchases
made with a common counterparty, as part of an arrangement similar to a physical exchange.
Where the group acts as agent on behalf of a third party to procure or market energy commodities, any associated fee income is recognized but no
purchase or sale is recorded.
Sales and other transactions through which the group loses control of solar projects developed under Lightsource bp’s develop-to-sell business model are
accounted for as revenues from contracts with customers.
Interest income is recognized as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate, that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts
through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset).
Dividend income from investments is recognized when the shareholders’ right to receive the payment is established.
Contract asset and contract liability balances are included within amounts presented for trade receivables and other payables respectively.
Finance costs
Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial
period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their
intended use. All other finance costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Updates to material accounting policy information
Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards
Amendments to IAS 7 ' Statement of Cash Flows' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: disclosures' relating to supplier finance have been adopted for the
consolidated financial statements for 2024, the additional required disclosures are provided in the Liquidity risk section of Note 29.
There are no new or other amended standards or interpretations adopted from 1 January 2024 onwards, that have a significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements for 2024.
Not yet adopted
Amendments to IFRS 9 ' Financial Instruments' relating to the settlement of liabilities through electronic payment systems are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2026 subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The potential impact on cash and banking operations and
amounts reported in cash and cash equivalents on adoption of the amendments is currently being assessed.
IFRS 18 ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ will supersede IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027 subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. IFRS 18 (and consequential amendments made to
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’, IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies: Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’, IAS 33 ‘Earnings per share’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosures’) introduces several new requirements that are expected to impact the presentation and disclosure of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements. These new requirements include:
• Requirements to classify all income and expenses included in the statement of profit or loss into one of five categories and to present two new
mandatory subtotals.
• Requirement to use the operating profit subtotal as the starting point for the indirect method of reporting cash flows from operating activities in the
statement of cash flows.
• Specific classification requirements for interest paid/received and dividends received in the statement of cash flows such that interest and dividend
receipts are included as investing cash flows and interest paid as financing cash flows.
• Required disclosures about certain non-GAAP measures (‘management defined performance measures’) in a single note to the financial statements
• Enhanced guidance on the aggregation of information across all the primary financial statements and the notes.
The group’s evaluation of the effect of adopting IFRS 18 is ongoing but it is currently anticipated that IFRS 18 will have a significant impact on the
presentation of the Group’s financial statements and related disclosures.

$1,105 million (2023 $62 million).
gas & low carbon energy
On 16 September 2024, bp announced that it plans to sell its US onshore wind energy business, bp Wind Energy. bp Wind Energy has interests in ten
operating onshore wind energy assets across seven US states. As a result of progression of the disposal process during the fourth quarter of 2024,
completion of a disposal in 2025 is now considered to be highly probable. The carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2024
is $569 million, with associated liabilities of $41 million.
On 24 October, bp completed the acquisition of the remaining 50.03% of Lightsource bp. The acquisition included certain assets for which sales processes
were in progress at the acquisition date. Completion of the sale of these assets within one year of the acquisition date is considered to be highly probable.
The carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2024 is $1,702 million, with associated liabilities of $1,050 million.
On 9 December 2024, bp and JERA Co., Inc. agreed to combine their offshore wind businesses to form a new standalone, equally-owned joint venture –
JERA Nex bp. The parties have agreed to work to complete formation of JERA Nex bp, subject to regulatory and other approvals, by end of the third quarter
of 2025. bp will contribute its development projects in the UK, Japan, Germany and US into the new joint venture. The related assets and liabilities of those
projects have, therefore, been classified as held for sale. The carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2024 is $1,793 million,
with associated liabilities of $14 million.
Transactions that have been classified as held for sale during 2024, but were completed by 31 December 2024, are described below.

3. Business combinations and other significant transactions
Business combinations
2024
The group undertook a number of business combinations during 2024. Total consideration was $2,119 million and the amount paid in cash in 2024
amounted to $978 million offset by cash acquired of $1,031 million.
These business combinations principally relate to the step acquisitions of bp Bunge Bioenergia and Lightsource bp. Total consideration for these two
acquisitions was $1,328 million and the amount paid in cash in 2024 was $227 million, offset by cash acquired of $589 million. The provisional fair value of
the net assets (including goodwill) recognized from these business combinations for 2024 was $2,848 million.
The gain recognized in ‘Interest and other income’ in 2024 as a result of remeasuring the previously held interests in bp Bunge Bioenergia and Lightsource
bp, to fair value, was $427 million.
Immediately prior to the Lightsource bp business combination, certain assets in the US were transferred from Lightsource bp into a new joint venture
which remains jointly controlled by bp and certain founder shareholders of Lightsource bp, and is accordingly equity accounted for by bp. The investment
in the new joint venture was measured at bp's share of the joint venture's net assets and, as a result, income of $498 million has been recognized in
‘Interest and other income’ in 2024.
Business combinations
2023
The group undertook a number of business combinations during 2023. Total consideration paid in cash amounted to $1,282 million, offset by cash
acquired of $484 million.
The fair value of the net assets (including goodwill) recognized from business combinations in the full year, inclusiveof measurement period adjustments
for business combinations in previous periods, was $1,228 million. This principally related to the acquisition of TravelCenters of America.

gas & low carbon energy
The 2024 impairment loss of $2,793 million includes amounts in Mauritania & Senegal ($1,495 million), which principally arose as a result of increased
forecast future expenditure, and a number of other individually immaterial impairments across the segment principally as a result of portfolio
management. The recoverable amounts of these cash generating units (CGUs) were based on value in use or fair value less costs of disposal calculations,
as appropriate. The recoverable amount of all CGUs for which impairment charges were recognized in 2024 is $3,423 million.
The 2023 impairment loss of $2,213 million primarily relates to losses incurred in respect of certain assets in Mauritania & Senegal ($1,434 million) and
principally arose as a result of increased forecast future expenditure. A further $565 million relates to producing assets in Trinidad and arose as a result of
changes to the group's oil and gas price and discount rate assumptions and activity phasing. The recoverable amount of all CGUs for which impairment
charges or reversals were recognized in 2023 in total, based on their value in use, is $4,811 million.
The 2022 impairment loss of $745 million primarily relates to losses incurred in respect of certain assets in Mauritania & Senegal ($729 million) and
principally arose as a result of increased forecast future expenditure. The 2022 impairment reversal of $1,333 million primarily relates to the Trinidad CGU
($1,331 million) and principally arose as a result of changes to the group's oil and gas price assumptions. The recoverable amount of all CGUs for which
impairment charges or reversals were recognized in 2022 in total, based on their value in use, is $9,609 million.
oil production & operations
Impairment losses and reversals in all years relate primarily to producing assets and, in 2022, equity accounted investments.
The 2024 impairment loss of $1,155 million primarily arose as a result of changes to reserves and tax assumptions in the North Sea ($1,035 million). The
recoverable amount of all CGUs for which impairment charges or reversals were recognized in 2024 in total, based on their value in use, is $8,705 million.
The 2023 impairment loss of $1,840 million primarily arose as a result of changes to the group's oil and gas price and discount rate assumptions, activity
phasing and disposal decisions in relation to certain assets in North Sea ($852 million) and in bpx energy ($802 million). The recoverable amount of all
CGUs for which impairment charges or reversals were recognized in 2023 in total, based on their value in use, is $14,072 million.
The 2022 impairment loss of $4,480 million primarily relates to impairment of the Pan American Energy Group S.L. joint venture as a result of expected
portfolio changes ($2,900 million) and the decision to exit bp's other businesses with Rosneft within Russia ($1,043 million). The 2022 impairment reversal
of $893 million principally relates to changes in price and reserves assumptions in the North Sea ($643 million). The recoverable amount of all CGUs for
which impairment charges or reversals were recognized in 2022 in total, based on their value in use, is $7,831 million.
customers & products
The 2024 impairment loss of $1,661 million primarily arises from the ongoing review of the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany ($807 million) and a number
of other individually immaterial impairments across the segment, principally as a result of changes to economic assumptions. The recoverable amount of
the CGUs were based on value-in-use calculations. The recoverable amount of all CGUs for which impairment charges or reversals were recognized in
2024 in total, based on their value-in-use, is $1,659 million.
The 2023 impairment loss of $1,614 million primarily relates to strategy implementation and changes to economic assumptions in the products business
including an impairment of the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany ($1,336 million). The recoverable amounts of the CGUs were based on value-in-use
calculations. The recoverable amount of all CGUs for which impairment charges or reversals were recognized in 2023 in total, based on their value in use,
is $327 million.
The 2022 impairment loss of $1,874 million primarily relates to changes in economic assumptions in the products business including an impairment of the
Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany ($1,366 million), and announced portfolio changes. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs were based on value-in-use
calculations. The recoverable amount of all CGUs for which impairment charges or reversals were recognized in 2022 in total, based on their value in use,
is $1,648 million.

other businesses and corporate
The 2022 impairment loss of $13,536 million arises primarily a result of bp's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft ($13,479 million, including
$528 million which relates to estimated earnings in the first two months of the year prior to the loss of significant influence). The recoverable amount of
the CGU which comprises Rosneft is estimated to be $nil.
5. Segmental analysis
The group’s organizational structure reflects the various activities in which bp is engaged as well as how performance and resource allocation is evaluated
by the chief operating decision maker. At 31 December 2024, bp has three reportable segments: Gas & low carbon energy, Oil production & operations, and
Customers & products. Each are managed separately, with decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and represent a single operating segment that
does not result from aggregating two or more segments.
Gas & low carbon energy comprises regions with upstream businesses that predominantly produce natural gas, gas marketing and trading activities and
the group's solar, wind and hydrogen businesses.
Oil production & operations comprises regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce crude oil.
Customers & products comprises the group’s customer-focused businesses, which includes convenience and retail fuels, EV charging, as well as Castrol,
aviation and B2B and midstream. It also includes our products businesses, refining & oil trading, as well as our bioenergya businesses.
Other businesses and corporate also comprises the group’s shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group’s accounting policies described in Note 1. However, IFRS requires that the
measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the
purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest and
tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and lossesb.
Replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved. Segment revenues and segment
results include transactions between business segments. These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless
unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group
subsidiary which made the sale. The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of customers & products.
All surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-employment benefit plans are allocated to Other
businesses and corporate. However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which
the employees work.
Certain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for bp, and for the UK as this is bp’s country of
domicile.
a In February 2025 bp announced its intention to move its biogas business to the gas & low carbon energy segment.
b Inventory holding gains and losses represent:
• the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in
provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting of inventories other than for trading inventories, the cost of
inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting
effect on reported income. The amounts disclosed as inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis (after
adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the replacement cost of
inventory is calculated using data from each operation’s production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach.
• an adjustment relating to certain trading inventories that are not price risk managed which relate to a minimum inventory volume that is required to be held to maintain underlying business activities. This
adjustment represents the movement in fair value of the inventories due to prices, on a grade-by-grade basis, during the period. This is calculated from each operation’s inventory management system on
a monthly basis using the discrete monthly movement in market prices for these inventories.
The amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss. No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a
trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions that are price risk-managed.

In 2024, the total tax credit recognized within other comprehensive income was $782 million (2023 $735 million credit and 2022 $266 million charge). In
2024 this primarily comprises a $658 million credit in respect of the reduction in the deferred tax liability on defined benefit pension plan surpluses
following the reduction in the rate of the authorized surplus payments tax charge in the UK from 35% to 25%. In 2023 this primarily comprises the deferred
tax impact of the remeasurements of the net pension and other post-employment benefit liability or asset. In 2022 this primarily comprises a release of
deferred withholding tax on other comprehensive income movements relating to Rosneft. See Note 32 for further information.
The total tax charge recognized directly in equity was $167 million (2023 $56 million charge and 2022 $214 million credit). In 2024 this mainly relates to
share-based payments and transactions involving non-controlling interests. In 2023 and 2022 this mainly relates to transactions involving non-controlling

Of the $5,403 million of deferred tax assets recognized on the group balance sheet at 31 December 2024 (2023 $4,268 million), $3,232 million (2023
$2,336 million) relates to entities that have suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period. For 2024, this mainly includes $1,680 million in
Germany, $744 million in Mauritania and $609 million in Senegal (2023 mainly included $1,003 million in Germany, $672 million in Mauritania and $500
million in Senegal). For 2024 these amounts are supported by forecasts consistent with bp's future oil and gas price assumptions (see Note 1 for further
information) and for Germany, forecast profits associated with the customers & products businesses, that indicate sufficient future taxable profits will be
available to utilize such assets within any applicable expiry period.

c The UK unused tax credits arise predominantly in overseas branches of UK entities based in jurisdictions with higher statutory corporate income tax rates than the UK. No deferred tax asset has been
recognized on these tax credits as they are unlikely to have value in the future; UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by double tax relief in respect of overseas tax. These tax credits
have no fixed expiry date.
d The US unused tax credits predominantly comprise foreign tax credits. No deferred tax asset has been recognized on these tax credits as they are unlikely to have value in the future. For 2024 these tax
credits expire in the period 2025-2034.
e 2024 and 2023 mainly comprise fixed asset temporary differences in overseas branches of UK entities. Substantially all of the temporary differences have no expiry date.

a One ADS is equivalent to six ordinary shares.
Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to bp ordinary shareholders by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The weighted average number of shares outstanding includes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share-based payment plans
and excludes treasury shares, which includes shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan trusts (ESOPs).
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the average number of
shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans. If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease
loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings
per share.

The number of ordinary shares outstanding at 31 December 2024, excluding treasury shares, and including certain shares that will be issuable in the future
under employee share-based payment plans was 15,851,028,983 (2023 16,824,651,796). Between 31 December 2024 and 14 February 2025, the latest
practicable date before the completion of these financial statements, there was a net decrease of 118,209,740 of ordinary shares primarily as a result of
share buy backs. For additional information on share buy backs see Note 31.
Employee share-based payment plans
The group operates share and share option plans for directors and certain employees to obtain ordinary shares and ADSs in the company. Information on
these plans for directors is shown in the Directors remuneration report on pages 88-110.
The following table shows the number of shares potentially issuable under equity-settled employee share option plans, including the number of options
outstanding, the number of options exercisable at the end of each year, and the corresponding weighted average exercise prices. The dilutive effect of
these plans at 31 December is also shown.

b At 31 December 2024 the quoted market price of one bp ordinary share was £3.93 (2023 £4.66).
In addition, the group operates a number of equity-settled employee share plans under which share units are granted to the group’s senior leaders and
certain other employees. These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends
which are treated as having been reinvested. Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements
apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons. The number of shares that are expected to vest each year under employee share plans are shown in
the table below. The dilutive effect of the employee share plans at 31 December is also shown.

synergies of the acquisition. For oil production & operations goodwill is allocated to CGUs in aggregate at the segment level, for gas & low carbon energy,
goodwill is allocated to the hydrocarbon CGUs ('gas businesses') within the segment and to Lightsource bp (LSbp). For customers and products, goodwill
has been allocated to Castrol, US Fuels, European Fuels, Archaea and Other.

amount (headroom) at the date of the most recent test. The recoverable amount for the gas businesses and the oil production & operations segment is
based on a pre-tax value-in-use calculation. The decrease in headroom for both of these goodwill impairment tests is due to changes in a number of
assumptions including prices and production as well as, for the oil productions & operations segment, certain tax assumptions and, for the gas
businesses, divestments. The recoverable amount for the LSbp goodwill is based on fair value less costs of disposal.
No material impairment of the goodwill balances in either gas & low carbon energy or oil production & operations was recognized during 2024 or 2023.

14. Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill – continued
Gas businesses and oil production & operations
The value in use for relevant CGUs in both the gas businesses and oil production & operations is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the
projected production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each field, based on appropriately risked estimates of reserves and
resources. Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment reviews of goodwill, as
they do not represent part of the grouping of CGUs to which the goodwill balances relate and which are used to monitor the goodwill balances for internal
management purposes. Where such activities form part of wider CGUs to which goodwill relates they are reflected in the test. As the production profile and
related cash flows can be estimated from bp’s past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the
appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment in both the gas businesses and oil & production operations. The
estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the
production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the
contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced. As each field has specific reservoir characteristics
and economic circumstances, the cash flows of each field are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by
bp management.
Estimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis, including operating and capital
expenditure, are derived from the business segment plans. The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as
part of bp’s centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.
The average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing in the gas businesses over the next 15 years is 154 mmboe per year (2023 185
mmboe per year) and in the oil production and operations segment is 400 mmboe per year (2023 402 mmboe per year). Production assumptions used for
the goodwill impairment tests in both the gas businesses and oil production & operations reflect management’s best estimate of future production of the
existing portfolio at the time of the calculation.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate used in the review for the oil production & operations segment is 17%, and 11% for the gas businesses (2023
17% for the oil production & operations segment and 11% for the gas businesses).
The most recent reviews for impairment for the oil production & operations and the gas businesses were carried out in the fourth quarter. The key
assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate. The value-in-use calculations
have been prepared for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balances were impaired. Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the
basis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the tests. The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made. For example, reserves and
resources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change.
Due to economic developments, regulatory change and emissions reduction activity arising from climate concern and other factors, future commodity
prices and other assumptions may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.
Sensitivities to different variables have been estimated using certain simplifying assumptions. For example, lower oil and gas price or production
sensitivities do not fully reflect the specific impacts for each contractual arrangement and will not capture all favourable impacts that may arise from cost
deflation or savings. A detailed calculation at any given price or production profile may, therefore, produce a different result.
It is estimated that a 11% (2023 22%) reduction in revenue throughout each year of the remaining life of those assets, either as a result of adverse price or
production conditions or a combination of each, would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-
current assets of the oil production and operations segment. For the gas businesses a 6% (2023 15%) reduction would have the same result.
It is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate of the oil production and operations segment would cause the recoverable amount
to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets. For the gas businesses a 2% increase would have this result (2023 no
reasonably possible change).
Lightsource bp
The Lightsource bp goodwill largely relates to the value attributed to the business’s project development capability, including the workforce in place.
Management considers the fair value of Lightsource bp at 31 December 2024 to be substantially the same as at the date of acquisition in the fourth
quarter of 2024.

Cash flows for each group of CGUs are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of up to five years, except for Archaea where a
business plan to 2035 is in place following the acquisition in 2022. To determine the value in use for each of the groups of cash-generating units, cash
flows for a period of 10 years (11 years for Archaea), are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value. Pre-tax discount rates ranging from 10-12% are
applied. It is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used in the US Fuels, European Fuels and Archaea goodwill impairment
assessments would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets.
No material impairment of the goodwill balances in customers & products was recognized during 2024 or 2023.
Castrol
The key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Castrol unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount
rate. Operating margin and sales volumes assumptions used in the detailed impairment review of goodwill calculation are consistent with the assumptions
used in the Castrol unit’s business plan. A pre-tax discount rate of 9% (2023 9%) is applied in the test. No reasonably possible change in any of these key
assumptions would cause the unit’s recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets. Cash flows
beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a nominal 3.4% (2023 3.4%) growth rate.

b Recognized in the Group income statement
c Other includes provisions for onerous contracts and restructuring costs.
The decommissioning provision primarily comprises the future cost of decommissioning oil and natural gas wells, facilities and related pipelines. The
environmental provision includes provisions for costs related to the control, abatement, clean-up or elimination of environmental pollution relating to soil,
groundwater, surface water and sediment contamination. The litigation and claims category includes provisions for matters related to, for example,
commercial disputes, product liability, and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances. Emissions provisions primarily relate to obligations
under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard Program and are driven by the amount of the obligations outstanding and
current price of the related credits. The provision will principally be settled through allowances already held as inventory in the group balance sheet.

24. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Pension
benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans (money purchase schemes) or defined benefit plans (final salary and other types of schemes
with committed pension benefit payments). For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from
contributions paid in respect of each employee. For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employee’s pensionable
salary and length of service. Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered
trusts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-employment benefits
in Note 1.
The defined benefit pension obligation in the UK consists primarily of a closed funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the
majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated
directors, four company-nominated directors, one independent director and one independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is
required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan.
Employees in the UK are eligible for membership of defined contribution plans established with third-party providers.
In the US, all pension benefits now accrue under a cash balance formula. Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected.
Retiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement. The plan is funded and its assets are
overseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee. At the end of 2024 the committee was composed of five bp employees appointed by the president of bp
Corporation North America Inc. (the appointing officer). The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants
and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan. US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined
contribution (401k) plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
In the US, group companies also provide post-employment healthcare to eligible retired employees and their dependants (and, in certain legacy cases, life
insurance coverage); the entitlement to these benefits is based on the date of hire, the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion
of a minimum period of service.
In the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries. In Germany and France, the majority of
the pensions are unfunded. In Germany, the group’s largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core
pension through salary sacrifice. For employees who joined since 2002, the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on
such factors as an employee’s pensionable salary and length of service. The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and
employees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law. Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of
an annuity. The German plans are governed by legal agreements between bp and the works council or between bp and the trade union.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2024 the aggregate level of contributions was $69 million (2023 $42 million and 2022 $74 million). The aggregate level of contributions in 2025 is
expected to be approximately $150 million and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under
contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
For the primary UK defined benefit plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions
is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2026 formal actuarial
valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2024.
The surplus relating to the primary UK defined benefit pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund
of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
Minimum pension funding in the US is determined by legislation and is supplemented by discretionary contributions. No contributions were made into the
US pension plan in 2024 and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.
The surplus relating to the US pension fund is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that economic benefit can be gained from the surplus through
a reduction in future contributions.
There was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2024.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-employment benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date
of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2024. The UK defined benefit plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years;
valuations are required more frequently in many other countries. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the primary UK defined benefit pension plan
was as at 31 December 2023. A valuation of the US plan and largest Eurozone plans are carried out annually.

a UK discount rate and inflation rate assumptions are not relevant in determining the benefit expense for the closed UK plan. Rates for the remaining small worldwide plan administered/reported through the
UK are 5.0% (2023 5.0% and 2022 2.5%) and 1.9% (2023 1.9% and 2022 2.2%) respectively.
The discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and for our largest plans in the UK, US and the Eurozone we use yields
that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments. The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference
between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or
advice from the local actuary depending on the information available. The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in
payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice
in the countries in which we provide pensions and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the
experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. bp’s most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US
and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows:

Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans. The
assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In
order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios
are highly diversified.
The trustee’s long-term investment objective for the primary UK defined benefit plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same
way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI)
approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability
assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money
using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further
bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in
the table below.
For the primary UK defined benefit plan there is an agreement with the trustee to at least maintain the proportion of assets with liability matching
characteristics and review over time. There is a similar agreement in place for the primary US plan. During 2024, the asset allocation policies of the
primary UK and US plans remained unchanged.
The current asset allocation policy for the major plans at 31 December 2024 was as follows:

The amounts invested under the LDI programme by the primary UK pension plan as at 31 December 2024 were $4,970 million (2023 $6,215 million) of
government-issued nominal bonds and $11,105 million (2023 $13,177 million) of index-linked bonds.
Some of the group’s pension plans in the Eurozone and other countries use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix to manage the level
of risk. The fair value of these instruments is included in other assets in the table below.
The group’s main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property/real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
The fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented in the table below, including the effects
of derivative financial instruments. Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 190.

a The costs of managing plan investments are offset against the investment return, the costs of administering pension plan benefits are generally included in current service cost and the costs of
administering other post-employment benefit plans are included in the benefit obligation. Following the closure of the primary UK pension plan, current service cost in the UK consists of $30 million of
costs of administering that plan and $11 million of current service cost from the remaining small worldwide plans administered and reported through the UK.
b Past service costs predominantly represent largely offsetting income and costs due to the removal of some benefits for members in Turkish plans and their replacement with new arrangements
administered and reported through the UK. Settlements reflect costs associated with buyouts in Canada and in certain other small worldwide plans administered and reported through the UK.
Sensitivity analysis
The discount rate, inflation and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one-percentage point change, in
isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2024 for the group’s pensions and other post-employment benefit expense would have had the effects
shown in the tables below. The effects shown for the expense in 2025 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.

27. Capital disclosures and net debt
The group defines capital as total equity plus net debt. Our financial framework seeks to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders while
maintaining a secure financial base.
The group monitors capital on the basis of gearing, that is, the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. Net debt is calculated as finance
debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest
rate risks relating to finance debt for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt and gearing are non-IFRS measures. bp
believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and
cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the
balance sheet within the headings ‘Derivative financial instruments’. All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
At 31 December 2024, gearing was 22.7% (2023 19.7%).

28. Leases
The group leases a number of assets as part of its activities. This primarily includes drilling rigs in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon
energy segments and retail service stations, oil depots and storage tanks in the customer & products segment as well as office accommodation and
vessel charters across the group. The weighted-average remaining lease term for the total lease portfolio is around 8 years (2023 7 years). Some leases
have payments that vary with market interest or inflation rates. Certain leases contain residual value guarantees, which may be triggered in certain
circumstances such as if market values have significantly declined at the conclusion of the lease.

Financial risk factors
The group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from ordinary business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including
market risks relating to commodity prices; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; credit risk; and liquidity risk.
The group financial risk committee (GFRC) advises the chief financial officer (CFO) who oversees the management of these risks. The GFRC is chaired by
the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the EVP supply, trading and shipping and SVPs treasury, tax, accounting reporting control
and planning & performance management. The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance
framework for the group. The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the chief executive officer (CEO), and via the CEO to the board, that the
group’s financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in
accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.
The group’s trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the supply, trading and shipping business. Treasury holds
foreign exchange and interest-rate products in the financial markets to hedge group exposures related to debt and hybrid bond issuance; the compliance,
control and risk management processes for these activities are managed within the treasury business. All other foreign exchange and interest rate
activities within financial markets are performed within the supply, trading and shipping business and are also underpinned by the compliance, control and
risk management infrastructure common to the activities of bp’s supply, trading and shipping business. All derivative activity is carried out by specialist
teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject to close financial and management control.
The supply, trading and shipping business maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operational risk
associated with trading activity. A policy and risk committee approves value-at-risk delegations, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies,
methodologies and procedures. A commitments committee approves the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.
In addition, the supply, trading and shipping business undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described
more fully below.
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business. The primary
commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the group’s financial
assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its
ordinary business exposures. In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management
purposes.
The major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.
(i) Commodity price risk
The group’s supply, trading and shipping business is responsible for delivering value across the overall crude, oil products, gas, LNG and power supply
chains. As such, it routinely enters into spot and term physical commodity contracts in addition to optimising physical storage, pipeline and transportation
capacity. These activities expose the group to commodity price risk which is managed by entering into oil, natural gas and power swaps, options and
futures.
The group measures market risk exposure arising from its risk managed trading positions using value-at-risk techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation
models. These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding
period within a 95% confidence level. Risk managed trading activity is subject to value-at-risk and other limits for each trading activity and the aggregate of
196 bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024

--- PAGE 199 ---
Financial statements
29. Financial instruments and financial risk factors – continued
all trading activity. The calculation of potential changes in value within the risk managed period considers positions, historical price movements and the
correlation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is maintained. The value-at-
risk measure is supplemented by stress testing and scenario analysis through simulating the financial impact of certain physical, economic and geo-
political scenarios. The value-at-risk measure in respect of the aggregated risk managed trading positions at 31 December 2024 was $42 million (2023 $26
million) whereas the average value-at-risk measure for the period was $35 million (2023 $49 million). This measure incorporates the effect of
diversification reflecting the offsetting risks across the trading portfolio. Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are not risk managed
and for which value-at-risk techniques are not appropriate.
(ii) Foreign currency exchange risk
Since bp has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the group’s reported results and future
expenditure commitments. The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost
competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions. For this reason, the
total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the group’s reported results. The main underlying economic currency of the
group’s cash flows is the US dollar. This is because bp’s major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars. bp’s foreign currency exchange
management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar. The group co-
ordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible and then
managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.
Most of the group’s borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar. At 31 December 2024, the total foreign currency borrowings
not swapped into US dollars amounted to $555 million (2023 $309 million). The group also has in issue perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in euro,
sterling and US dollars. Whilst the contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal
indefinitely, the group has chosen to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods.
The group manages the net residual foreign currency exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage
such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million. At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the
maximum risk limit. A continuous assessment is made in respect of the group’s foreign currency exposures to capture hedging requirements.
During the year, hedge accounting was applied to foreign currency exposure to highly probable forecast capital expenditure commitments. The group fixes
the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards for the highly probable forecast capital expenditure. At 31 December 2024 the
most significant open contracts in place were for USD equivalent amounts of $92 million sterling (2023 $296 million sterling).
Where the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-at-risk
techniques as explained in (i) commodity price risk above.
(iii) Interest rate risk
bp is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial
instruments, principally finance debt. While the group issues debt and hybrid bonds in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses
derivatives to swap the economic exposure to a floating rate basis, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar
fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt. The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2024 was 30% of total finance
debt outstanding (2023 35%). The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2024 was 5% (2023 5%) and the weighted average
maturity of fixed rate debt was eight years (2023 thirteen years).
The group’s earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the element of the group’s finance debt that is contractually floating rate or has been
swapped to floating rates. If the interest rates applicable to these floating rate instruments of $18,006 million (2023 $18,238 million) (see Note 26) were to
have changed by one percentage point on 1 January 2025, it is estimated that the group’s finance costs for 2025 would change by approximately $180
million (2023 $182 million).
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the
group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit
exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables. Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which
the outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2024 was $655 million (2023 $1,655 million) in respect of
liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $585 million (2023 $598 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. An amount of $146 million
(2023 $201 million) is recorded as a liability at 31 December 2024 in relation to these guarantees. For all guarantees, maturity dates vary, and the
guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. In general, a payment under the guarantee contract would be triggered by
failure of the guaranteed party to fulfil its obligation covered by the guarantee.

29. Financial instruments and financial risk factors – continued
The group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO, that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and
control credit risk. Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business. On entering into any business contract the extent to which
the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered. Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any
sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk; the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty
exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported; and the timely identification and reporting of any non-
approved credit exposures and credit losses. While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group
policy, treasury holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.
For the purposes of financial reporting the group calculates expected loss allowances based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is
exposed to credit risk. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the credit risk associated with the significant majority of
financial assets measured at amortized cost is considered to be low. Since the tenor of substantially all of the group's in-scope financial assets is less than
12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses. Expected loss allowances for
financial guarantee contracts are typically lower than their initial fair value less, where appropriate, amortization. Financial assets are considered to be
credit-impaired when there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash
flows of the financial asset have occurred. This includes observable data concerning significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; a breach of
contract; concession being granted to the counterparty for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty’s financial difficulty, that would
not otherwise be considered; it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial re-organization or an active market for the
financial asset disappearing because of financial difficulties. The group also applies a rebuttable presumption that an asset is credit-impaired when
contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a
portion thereof, for example where all legal avenues for collection of amounts due have been exhausted, the financial asset (or relevant portion) is written
off.
The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss after recovery if
there is a default) and the exposure at default (i.e. the asset's carrying amount). The group allocates a credit risk rating to exposures based on data that is
determined to be predictive of the risk of loss, including but not limited to external ratings. Probabilities of default derived from historical, current and
future-looking market data are assigned by credit risk rating with a loss given default based on historical experience and relevant market and academic
research applied by exposure type. Experienced credit judgement is applied to ensure probabilities of default are reflective of the credit risk associated with
the group's exposures. Credit enhancements that would reduce the group's credit losses in the event of default are reflected in the calculation when they
are considered integral to the related asset.
The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount. The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but
expects to experience a certain level of credit losses. As at 31 December 2024, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate
approximately $9.2 billion (2023 $12.0 billion) of credit risk of which approximately $8.2 billion (2023 $10.7 billion) related to assets in the scope of IFRS 9's
impairment requirements. Credit enhancements include standby and documentary letters of credit, bank guarantees, insurance and liens which are
typically taken out with financial institutions who have investment grade credit ratings, or are liens over assets held by the counterparty of the related
receivables. Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the group’s overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure
by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.
Management information used to monitor credit risk, which reflects the impact of credit enhancements, indicates that the risk profile of financial assets
which are subject to review for impairment under IFRS 9 is as set out in the table below.

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the group’s business activities may not be available. The group’s liquidity is managed centrally
with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function. Unless restricted by local regulations, generally
subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to the treasury function, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries’ requirements, or invest any net surplus in
the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the group’s overall net currency positions. While there is the potential for
concerns about the energy transition to impact banks’ or debt investors’ appetite to finance hydrocarbon activity, we do not anticipate any material change
to the group's funding or liquidity in the short to medium term as a result of such concerns.
The group benefits from open credit provided by suppliers who generally sell on five to 60-day payment terms in accordance with industry norms. bp
utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow. This includes discounting of receivables and, in the
supply and trading businesses, managing inventory, collateral and supplier payment terms within a maximum of 60 days.
It is normal practice in the oil and gas supply and trading business for customers and suppliers to utilize letters of credit (LCs) facilities to mitigate credit
and non-performance risk. Consequently, LCs facilitate active trading in a global market where credit and performance risk can be significant. In common
with the industry, bp routinely provides LCs to some of its suppliers.
The group has committed LC facilities totalling $12,130 million (2023 $13,180 million), allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum 24-month duration. The
facilities are held with 16 international banks.
In certain circumstances, the supplier has the option to request accelerated payment from the LC provider in order to further reduce their exposure. bp’s
payments are made to the provider of the LC rather than the supplier according to the original contractual payment terms. At 31 December 2024, a portion
of the group’s trade payables which were subject to the LC arrangements were payable to LC providers, with no material exposure to any individual
provider. If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that payment terms were shorter.
The group sometimes uses promissory notes to pay its suppliers and other counterparties. This is primarily done to facilitate the counterparty accelerating
its cash inflow without also accelerating the group’s related cash outflow. For instance, if a supplier to the group’s supply, trading and shipping business
would like prepayment or early-payment for a supply of goods, the group may issue a promissory note (payable at a future date) in favour of that supplier
on the supplier’s desired cash inflow date, which that supplier can then convert to cash by selling it to a finance provider on the same-day. The majority of
promissory notes the group issues accrue interest on the principal amount of the note at a fixed rate stated on the note from issuance to maturity. This is
done to give the supplier or other counterparty certainty about the amount they will receive when they sell the note. It also gives the group flexibility to
select the maturity date of the note without that impacting the net present value of the note on its issuance date. The maturity date the group selects for
any promissory note that is for the purchase of goods by its supply and trading business will be no more than 60 days after the group takes (or expects to
take) title to those goods.
A portion of the group's trade payables form part of a reverse factoring arrangement with select suppliers.
Suppliers’ participation in the reverse factoring arrangement is voluntary. Suppliers that participate have the option to receive early payment on invoices
from the group’s external finance provider. If suppliers choose to receive early payment, they pay a fee to the finance provider. If they opt not to receive
early payment, they will pay no fee to the finance provider and will be paid the full invoice amount on the invoice due date. The group provides data about
invoices subject to the arrangement directly to the finance provider. This data includes the invoice due date and the maturity date for each invoice. The
invoice due date is the date the supplier would have been entitled to receive payment from the group had the invoice not been made subject to the reverse
factoring arrangement. The maturity date, which is the date the group will settle that invoice by paying the finance provider, will, in some cases, be the
same as the invoice due date. In other cases, it will be a date selected by the group that is no more than 60 days after the group has taken title to the goods
to which the invoice relates. If the group selects a maturity date that is after the invoice due date, the group pays the finance provider a fee.
Management does not consider the reverse factoring arrangement to result in excessive concentrations of liquidity risk, in part because the finance
provider has the option to (and does) sub-participate portions of the financings to other finance providers. The arrangements have been established for a
variety of reasons, including to ease the administrative burden of managing high volumes of invoices from some suppliers, to facilitate some suppliers
having the option to accelerate when they receive payment or, often at a lower cost than that supplier’s usual cost of borrowing, and, in some cases, to
manage the working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow of the group’s supply and trading business. The group has not derecognised the original
trade payables relating to the arrangements because the original liability is not substantially modified on entering into the arrangements.

b The group applied transitional relief available under IAS 7 and has not provided comparative information in the first year of adoption.
The group does not provide any collateral to the external finance provider.
There were no material business combinations or foreign exchange differences that would affect the liabilities under the supplier finance arrangement in
either period.
There were no significant non-cash changes in the carrying amount of financial liabilities subject to the supplier finance arrangements. The payments to
the bank are included within operating cash flows because they continue to be part of the normal operating cycle of the group and their principal nature
remains operating – i.e., payment for the purchase of goods and services.
If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that settlement periods were shorter.
Standard & Poor’s Ratings long-term credit rating for bp is A- (stable) and Moody’s Investors Service rating is A1 (stable) and the Fitch Ratings' long-term
credit rating is A+ (stable).
During 2024, $9 billion (2023 $6 billion) of long-term taxable bonds were issued with terms ranging from three to twelve years. In addition the group issued
perpetual hybrid capital bonds and securities with a US dollar equivalent value of $4.3 billion (2023 $0.2 billion). Commercial paper is issued at competitive
rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.
As a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $39.2 billion at 31 December
2024 (2023 $33.0 billion), primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice. As at 31
December 2024, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of an undrawn committed $8.0 billion credit
facility and $4.0 billion of standby facilities. $7.8 billion of the credit facility was available for one year and $0.2 billion was available for less than 1 year.
$3.9 billion of the standby facilities were available for 3 years and $0.1 billion were available for 2 years. These facilities were unutilized and were held with
27 international banks. In January 2025, the committed credit facility and standby facilities were replaced by new borrowing facilities, consisting of an
undrawn committed $8.0 billion credit facility and $4.0 billion of standby facilities. These new facilities are available for 5 years, are held with 33
international banks and borrowings via these facilities would be at pre-agreed rates
For further information on the group's sources and uses of cash see Liquidity and capital resources on page 316.
The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both
derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 30. Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows, other than noted below, that could be of
a significantly different amount or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.

settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US
dollar finance debt or hybrid bonds. The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered
to be negligible. Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts (inflows) for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay
leg, which amount to $24,206 million at 31 December 2024 (2023 $24,120 million) to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.

30. Derivative financial instruments
In the ordinary course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its normal business exposures in relation
to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt,
consistent with its risk management policies and objectives. An outline of the group’s financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to
those risks is set out in Note 29. Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with
these activities using a similar range of contracts.
For information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.
Exchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date. These derivatives are categorized
within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange traded derivatives are typically considered settled through the (normally daily) payment or receipt of
variation margin.
Over-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps, forwards and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available
information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are
categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and
physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between
various commodities, and that result in management’s best estimate of fair value. These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

30. Derivative financial instruments – continued
Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward
prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors. The
degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy.

Derivatives held for trading
The group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives. The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply
requirements or for entrepreneurial trading. Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are
recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types
in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods. The net of these exposures is monitored
using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 29.

The amount recognized in the income statement for the year relating to level 3 held-for-trading derivatives still held at 31 December 2024 was a $193
million loss (2023 $631 million gain related to derivatives still held at 31 December 2023).
Derivative gains and losses
The group enters into derivative contracts including futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, relating to both
currency and commodity trading activities. Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and
entrepreneurial trading. They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair
valued under accounting standards. These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement. Also included
within this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes. The total amount relating to all these items was a net gain of $9,726
million (2023 $19,786 million net gain). This number does not include gains and losses on the change in value of contracts which are not recognized under
IFRS such as transportation and storage contracts, but does include the associated financially settled contracts. The net amounts for actual gains and
losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.
As outlined in Note 1 - Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments, LNG contracts are only recognised in the financial statements
when associated cargoes are lifted. The embedded value in these contracts is not recognised and is subject to underlying commodity price volatility. bp
generally price risk manages the exposure to LNG cargoes due for delivery in the near term where there is a liquid market. It does so on a portfolio basis
using derivative instruments amongst other price risk management strategies. Under IFRS, these derivative instruments, which are subject to similar price
volatility, are recorded at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting period, which creates an accounting mismatch in the financial statements
between the accounting for LNG contracts and the derivatives used for risk management. For the year ended 31 December 2024, there were no material
gains or losses recorded on the associated derivative positions. For the year ended 31 December 2023, there were material gains recognized on the
associated derivative positions due to the movement in the underlying commodity prices. . For additional information, details of management’s internal
measure of performance are given in the Group Performance Report on page 24 and on page 314.
The group also enters into derivative contracts relating to foreign currency risk management activities including contracts that the group has entered into
to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The change in the unrealized value
of these contracts was a net loss of $404 million (2023 $632 million net gain and 2022 $1,280 million net loss). Where the derivative is economically
hedging finance debt, gains and losses on such derivative contracts are included within finance costs. Where the derivative is managing non-US hybrid
bond exposure gains and loss are included within production and manufacturing expenses. Where these gains and losses arise on derivatives hedging
finance debt they are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt. The net amounts
for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.
Cash flow hedges
(i) Foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast capital expenditure
At 31 December 2024, the group held currency forwards designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of highly probable forecast
non-US dollar capital expenditure. Note 29 outlines the group’s approach to foreign currency exchange risk management. When the highly probable
forecast capital expenditure designated as a hedged item occurs, a non-financial asset is recognized and is presented within the fixed asset section of the
balance sheet.
The group claims hedge accounting only for the spot value of the currency exposure in line with the strategy to fix the volatility in the spot exchange rate
element. The fair value on the instrument attributable to forward points and foreign currency basis spreads is taken immediately to the income statement.

30. Derivative financial instruments – continued
The group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an
economic relationship is determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged
item. The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the currency and notional of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is
determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional designated on the forecast transaction. The group determines the extent
to which it hedges highly probable forecast capital expenditures on a project by project basis.
The group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:
• counterparty's credit risk, the group mitigates counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with high credit quality counterparties; and
• differences in settlement timing between the derivative and hedged items. The latter impacts the discount factor used in the calculation of the hedge
ineffectiveness. The group mitigates differences in timing between the derivatives and hedged items by applying a rolling strategy and by hedging
currency pairs from stable economies. The group's cash flow hedge designations are highly effective as the sources of ineffectiveness identified are
expected to result in minimal hedge ineffectiveness.
The group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.
(ii) Commodity price risk of highly probable forecast sales
During the period the group held Henry Hub NYMEX futures designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of certain highly probable
forecast future sales. Henry Hub NYMEX futures are subject to daily settlement, where their fair value at the end of each day is required to be cash settled,
such that the carrying amount of these hedging instruments within continuing hedge relationships is always zero at the end of each day.
The group is exposed to the variability in the gas price, but only applied hedge accounting to the risk of Henry Hub price movements for a percentage of
future gas sales from its BPX Energy business.
The group applied hedge accounting in relation to these highly probable future sales where there was an economic relationship between the hedged item
and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship was determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the
hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group entered into hedging derivatives that matched the notional amounts of the hedged items on a
1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio was determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount designated on the
forecast transaction.
The hedge was highly effective due to the price index of the hedging instruments matching the price index of the hedged item. The group did not designate
any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.
The tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.

Fair value hedges
At 31 December 2024, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk and foreign
currency risk arising from group fixed rate debt issuances. Note 29 outlines the group’s approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk
management. The interest rate swaps are used to convert US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt. The cross-currency interest
rate swaps are used to convert sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone denominated fixed rate
borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt. The group manages all risks derived from debt issuance, such as credit risk, however, the group applies hedge
accounting only to certain components of interest rate and foreign currency risk in order to minimize hedge ineffectiveness. The interest rate and foreign
currency exposures are identified and hedged on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
For interest rate exposures, the group designates as a fair value hedge the benchmark interest rate component only. This is an observable and reliably
measurable component of interest rate risk. For foreign currency exposures, the group excludes from the designation the foreign currency basis spread
component implicit in the cross-currency interest rate swaps. This is separately calculated at hedge designation, is recognized in other comprehensive
income over the life of the hedge and amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis, in accordance with the group’s policy on costs of
hedging.

30. Derivative financial instruments – continued
The group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an
economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively
assessed using linear regression analysis. The group issues fixed rate debt and enters into interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps with critical
terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with
the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt. Both the hedging instrument and the
hedged item are expected to be held to maturity.
The group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:
• derivative counterparty’s credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is mitigated by entering into derivative transactions only with high
credit quality counterparties; and
• sensitivity to interest rate between the hedged item and the derivatives. This is driven by differences in payment frequencies between the instrument
and the bond.
The tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period. The
signage convention for changes in fair value presented in this table is consistent with that presented in Note 27.

32. Capital and reserves – continued
Share capital
The balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.
Share premium account
The balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.
Capital redemption reserve
The balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.
Merger reserve
The balance on the merger reserve represents the premium arising where the fair value of the consideration given is in excess of the nominal value of the
ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares where merger relief under the Companies Act applies.
Treasury shares
Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes shares held in Employee Share
Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and bp’s US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in
the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the group and
have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally
to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as
assets and liabilities of the group.
Investments in equity instruments
This reserve records the change in fair value of investments in equity instruments for which the group has elected to recognize fair value gains and losses
in other comprehensive income.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. Upon
disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are reclassified to the income statement.
Cash flow hedges
This reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge. For further
information on the accounting for cash flow hedges see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Costs of hedging
This reserve records the change in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments to which cost of hedge accounting has been
applied. The accumulated amount relates to time-period related hedged items and is amortized to profit or loss over the term of the hedging relationship.
For further information on the accounting for costs of hedging see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.
Profit and loss account
The balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the group.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within non-
controlling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds, perpetual subordinated hybrid securities and certain equity instruments with preferred
distributions issued by group subsidiaries. The contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments, equity distributions and
repayment of principal indefinitely. However, the terms and conditions of each instrument stipulate the circumstances in which deferred payments and/or
the principal amount of the instrument becomes payable. These circumstances, which include the announcement of a bp p.l.c. ordinary share or parity
equity dividend distribution, are within the group’s control.
Perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds are issued by BP Capital Markets p.l.c., a group subsidiary, in euro, sterling and US dollars. During the year BP Capital
Markets p.l.c. voluntarily bought back $1.3 billion of the non-call 2025 4.375% US dollar hybrid bonds issued in 2020 and issued euro, sterling and US dollar
hybrid bonds for a US dollar equivalent amount of $3.9 billion. Coupons on the new issuances are fixed for an initial period up to dates from 2030 to 2035
at rates of 4.375% to 6.45%. As at 31 December 2024 the total population of hybrid bonds include redemption options exercisable at the group’s discretion
from June 2025 to March 2035 (the first ‘call date’), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or
tax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue. Coupons are fixed for an initial period up to dates from September 2025 to June 2035 at rates
of 3.25% to 6.45% and reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. Whilst the contractual terms of
these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, the group has chosen to swap the non-US dollar
hybrid bonds to a USD floating interest rate up to their respective first call periods. Payments made to and profit attributed to these hybrid bonds in the
year totalled $485 million (2023 $477 million) and $517 million (2023 $473 million) respectively. The amount of hybrid bonds included in non-controlling
interests at the end of the year was $14.6 billion (2023 $12.1 billion).
Perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by group subsidiaries include $500 million issued during 2024, specifically earmarked to fund BP
Alternative Energy Investments Ltd including the funding of Lightsource bp. Payments made to and profit attributed to perpetual hybrid securities in the
year totalled $125 million (2023 $114 million) and $125 million (2023 $113 million) respectively. The amount of perpetual subordinated hybrid securities
included within non-controlling interests at the end of the year was $2.0 billion (2023 $1.5 billion).
Equity instruments with preferred distributions issued by group subsidiaries include $1,330 million issued during 2024 comprising $500 million of proceeds
from the sale of a 49% interest in a subsidiary that holds certain midstream assets offshore US; and $830 million of proceeds from the sale of a 25% non-
controlling interest in BP Pipelines TAP Limited, the bp subsidiary that holds a 20% share in Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG. In both transactions, the group
retains control over the ability to defer equity distributions which are not guaranteed, and investors have no right to redeem their shares other than in
certain circumstances that are within the group’s control. The amount associated with equity instruments with preferred distributions included within non-
controlling interests at the end of the year was approximately $1.3 billion (2023 $0.3 billion).

33. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings
Contingent liabilities
There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2024 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the group’s
business. No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 29.
In the normal course of the group’s business, bp group entities are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of current and past operations,
including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general
health, safety, climate change and environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint,
asbestos and other chemicals. The amounts claimed could be significant and could be material to the group’s results of operations, financial position or
liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp expects that the impact of current legal and regulatory proceedings on the
group‘s results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.
The group files tax returns in many jurisdictions across the world. Various tax authorities are currently examining these returns, which contain matters that
could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. The resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax
authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete and the amounts could be significant and could, in aggregate, be material to the
group’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp does not expect there to
be any material impact upon the group‘s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2024 217

--- PAGE 220 ---
33. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings – continued
The group is subject to numerous national and local health, safety and environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other
activities. These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release
of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil
fields, commodities extraction sites, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites. In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset
sales or closed facilities. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its costs are inherently difficult to estimate. However, the estimated cost of
environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the group‘s accounting policies. While the amounts of future possible
costs that are not provided for could be significant and material to the group‘s results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not
possible to estimate the amounts involved. bp does not expect these costs to have a material impact on the group’s results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.
If production and manufacturing facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning
obligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, bp could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning. The group estimates that for
production facilities, approximately $16 billion (2023 $16 billion) of associated decommissioning obligations were previously transferred to third parties.
While the amounts associated with decommissioning provisions reverting to the group could be material, bp is not currently aware of any such material
cases that have a greater than remote chance of reverting to the group. Furthermore, as described in Provisions and contingencies within Note 1,
decommissioning provisions associated with customers & products facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured
given their indeterminate settlement dates.
By their nature, it is not practicable to estimate the potential financial impact or possible timing of the above contingencies as there are significant
uncertainties that are dependent on various factors that are not within the group’s control.
Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of America oil spill
For information on legal proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, see Legal proceedings below. Any outstanding Deepwater Horizon related
claims are not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial performance.
Legal proceedings
Proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill
Introduction
BP Exploration & Production Inc. (BPXP) was lease operator of Mississippi Canyon, Block 252 in the Gulf of America, where the semi-submersible rig
Deepwater Horizon was deployed at the time of the 20 April 2010 explosion and fire and resulting oil spill (the Incident). Lawsuits and claims arising from
the Incident were brought principally in US federal and state courts. The remaining proceedings arising from the Incident are discussed below.
Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement
In 2012 the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement (Medical Settlement) was entered into with the plaintiffs steering committee. It includes an exclusive
remedy provision regarding class members pursuing exposure-based personal injury claims for later-manifested physical conditions (LMPCs). As of 31
December 2024, there were 26 pending lawsuits brought by class members claiming LMPCs.
Other civil complaints – personal injury
The vast majority of post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury claims from individuals that either opted out of the Medical
Settlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been dismissed (including more than 620 cases in which the courts granted BPXP’s motions
for summary judgment). As of 31 December 2024, 38 cases remained pending in the district courts.
Non-US government lawsuits
Two class actions are pending in Mexican Federal District Courts against various bp group entities including BPXP and BP America Production Company
by separate plaintiff classes. Although the two actions are separate, both broadly seek penalties, damages and compensation for alleged environmental,
health and economic harm in Mexico as a result of the Incident. One of the actions also seeks an order requiring the bp defendants to repair alleged
damage to Mexican waters and land.
bp has answered the complaints in both actions by seeking dismissal on various grounds including that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there
was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico.
These legal actions remain at a relatively early stage and while it is not possible to predict the outcome, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends
to defend such actions vigorously.

33. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings – continued
Other legal proceedings
Climate change
BP p.l.c., BP America Inc. and BP Products North America Inc. are co-defendants with other oil and gas companies in approximately 30 lawsuits brought in
various state and federal courts on behalf of various governmental and private parties. The lawsuits generally assert claims under a variety of legal
theories seeking to hold the defendant companies responsible for impacts allegedly caused by and/or relating to climate change. Underlying many of the
legal theories are allegations regarding deceptive communication and disinformation to the public. The lawsuits seek remedies including payment of
money and other forms of equitable relief. If such suits were successful, the cost of the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial.
Defendants spent several years seeking to have the cases removed to federal courts, however Defendants’ attempts were ultimately unsuccessful.
Accordingly, the cases are proceeding in various state courts. As a group, the lawsuits generally remain at relatively early stages in the litigation process.
While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.
Louisiana Coastal restoration
Six coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed over 40 separate lawsuits in state courts in Louisiana against various oil and gas companies
seeking damages for coastal erosion. bp entities were named defendants in 17 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants' historical
operations in oil and gas fields within the Louisiana onshore coastal zone failed to comply with state permits and/or were conducted without the required
coastal use permits. The scope and scale of plaintiffs’ damages demands are significant and unprecedented, including substantial remediation costs,
natural resource (ecological impact) damages and the claimed costs for restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil and gas field operations.
Defendants removed all of these lawsuits to federal court and the removals were contested by plaintiffs, eventually resulting in a decision from the US Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals rejecting defendants’ “federal officer” jurisdiction removal grounds in one of two lead cases – Plaquemines Parish v. Riverwood, et
al. Defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari to the US Supreme Court seeking review of the US Fifth Circuit’s Riverwood decision was denied in early 2023.
In 2024, the US Fifth Circuit issued a further final ruling rejecting “federal officer” jurisdiction in a subset of the removed cases contested on a related
removal theory and remanded all such cases to state district court.
Following remand of the other lead removal case, Cameron Parish v. Auster, et. al., in which bp was the principal defendant, bp entered into a settlement
agreement and release with the plaintiffs in late 2023 in respect of all state and local governmental claims arising within Cameron Parish. The terms of the
settlement agreement and release are confidential and have not had and are not expected to have in the future, a significant effect on the company’s
financial position or profitability.
Atlantic Richfield Company, a bp affiliate, was a named defendant along with other oil & gas companies in a case, Plaquemines Parish v. Rozel, et al, set for
trial in March 2025. A state trial court in December 2024 ruled in favour of Atlantic Richfield’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed it from the
case, but following a motion by plaintiffs for reconsideration, the court reversed its summary judgment ruling and reinstated Atlantic Richfield as a
defendant. The plaintiffs’ claims against Atlantic Richfield have been severed from the initial March 2025 trial date, and the court has yet to establish a new
trial date for the plaintiffs’ now separate claims against Atlantic Richfield.
No bp entity is a named defendant in any of the other active Louisiana Coastal restoration docket cases with a trial date, all of which remain in the early
stages of litigation. In addition, four private landowners have filed separate claims in the state courts in Jefferson and Plaquemines Parishes of Louisiana
for restoration damages related to alleged impacts to their marshlands associated with historic oil field operations. bp entities are defendants in two of
these private landowner cases, having been previously dismissed from a third.
While it is not possible to predict the outcomes of these novel legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions
vigorously.

The audit committee has established pre-approval policies and procedures for the engagement of Deloitte to render audit and certain assurance and other
services. The audit fees payable to Deloitte were considered as part of the audit tender process in 2016 and challenged by the audit committee through
comparison with the audit pricing proposals of the other bidding firms. Changes in audit fees subsequent to the audit tender, including matters relevant to
the 2024 audit, have been reviewed and challenged by the Audit Committee, before being approved. Deloitte performed further assurance services that
were not prohibited by regulatory or other professional requirements and were pre-approved by the Committee. Deloitte is engaged for these services
when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Most of this work is of an audit-related or assurance nature.
Under SEC regulations, the remuneration of the auditor of $66 million (2023 $61 million and 2022 $56 million) is required to be presented as follows: audit
$57 million (2023 $53 million and 2022 $51 million); other audit-related $4 million (2023 $4 million and 2022 $4 million); tax $nil (2023 $nil and 2022 $nil);
and all other fees $5 million (2023 $4 million and 2022 $1 million).

38. Events after the reporting period
On 26 February 2025, bp announced a fundamentally reset strategy, with significant capital reallocation, and plans to drive improved performance, aimed
at growing free cash flow, returns and long-term shareholder value. This strategy will see bp grow its upstream oil and gas business, focus its downstream
business, and invest with increasing discipline into the transition. It builds on bp’s distinct strengths and competitive advantages as an integrated energy
company. There are no impacts on these financial statements related to the strategy announcements in accordance with IAS 10 ‘Events after the reporting
period’.

Supplementary information on oil and natural gas (unaudited)
The regional analysis presented below is on a continent basis, with separate disclosure for countries that contain 15% or more of the total proved reserves
(for subsidiaries plus equity-accounted entitiesa), in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements.
Oil and gas reserves – certain definitions
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the following terms have the meanings shown below:
Proved oil and gas reserves
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable
certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods,
and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is
reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must
have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any; and
(B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically
producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration
unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap,
proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and
reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.
(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are
included in the proved classification when:
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favourable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of
an installed programme in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty
of the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based; and
(B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the
average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding
escalations based upon future conditions.
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production
when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are
scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other
improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an
analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
Developed oil and gas reserves
Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared
to the cost of a new well; and
(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not
involving a well.
For details on bp’s proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes, see pages 318-326.

Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes therein relating to proved oil and gas reserves
The following tables set out the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, and changes therein, relating to crude oil and natural gas
production from the group’s estimated proved reserves. This information is prepared in compliance with FASB Oil and Gas Disclosures requirements.
Future net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized. These include the timing of future
production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of average crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates from
the previous 12 months. Furthermore, both proved reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information
becomes available and economic conditions change. bp cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of the
assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.

Productive oil and gas wells and acreage
The following tables show the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and
natural gas acreage in which the group and its equity-accounted entities had interests as at 31 December 2024. A ‘gross’ well or acre is one in which a
whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of ‘net’ wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells
or acres. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which
development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves; while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or
completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.

Notes on financial statements
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions
Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure
Framework’ (FRS 101)
The financial statements of BP p.l.c. for the year ended 31 December 2024 were approved and signed by the chief executive officer on 6 March 2025
having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard
100 ‘Application of Financial Reporting Requirements’ (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, these financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting
standards.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration
given in exchange for the assets.
As permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to:
(a) the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial
Statements’;
(b) the requirements of IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows' (excluding paragraphs 1 to 44E, 44H(b)(ii) and 45 to 63 which are not applicable’;
(c) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ in relation to standards not yet
effective;
(d) the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’;
(e) the requirements of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group,
provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member;
(f) the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c)-135(e) of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets;
(g) the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment';
(h) the requirements of IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; and
(i) the requirement of the second sentence of paragraph 110 and paragraphs 113(a), 114,115, 118, 119(a) to (c), 120 to 127 and 129 of IFRS 15 'Revenue
from Contracts with Customers'.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.
There are no new IFRS Accounting Standards or amended standards or interpretations adopted from 1 January 2024 onwards that have a significant
impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 18 ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ will supersede IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027 subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. IFRS 18 (and consequential amendments made to
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’, IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies: Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’, IAS 33 ‘Earnings per share’ and IFRS 7 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosures’) introduces several new requirements that are expected to impact the presentation and disclosure of the Company's financial
statements. These new requirements include:
• Requirements to classify all income and expenses included in the statement of profit or loss into one of five categories and to present two new
mandatory subtotals.
• Required disclosures about certain non-GAAP measures (‘management defined performance measures’) in a single note to the financial statements.
• Enhanced guidance on the aggregation of information across all the primary financial statements and the notes.
The Company’s evaluation of the effect of adopting IFRS 18 is ongoing.
Material accounting policy information: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions
Inherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is the need for bp management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements
and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the Company are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the
information provided in the Notes on financial statements.
The areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the financial statements are the recoverability of investment
carrying values and pensions. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and
geopolitical environment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the financial statements are also set out in boxed text
below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.
The parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 251-310 do not form part of bp’s Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.

Financial statements
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy
Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the financial statements. These may have significant impacts
on the currently reported amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities discussed below.
Impairment of investments
The recoverable amounts of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries are closely linked to the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and
goodwill in the individual subsidiaries. The energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn
may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management’s best estimate of oil and
natural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing were revised during 2024. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real
2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per
barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy
system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00
per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. The revised assumptions for Brent oil
and Henry Hub gas sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with
the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards
to the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment.
Going concern
Liquidity and financing is managed within bp under pooled group-wide arrangements which include the Company. As part of assuring the going concern
basis of preparation for the Company, the ability and intent of the bp group to support the Company has been taken into consideration. The most recent
bp group financial statements (see pages 115 to 222) continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a
number of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the
group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements even if the
Brent price fell to zero. In addition, group management of bp have confirmed that the existing intra-group funding and liquidity arrangements as currently
constituted are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, being no less than twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. No
material uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. Accordingly, the Company will be
able to draw on support from the bp group for the foreseeable future and these financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern
basis.
Pensions
The volatility in the financial markets during 2024 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of
defined benefit obligations in the group’s defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and Note 4 for further information.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable
amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount. Where these circumstances have reversed, the impairment previously made is reversed to the extent of the original cost of the
investment.
Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values
Determination as to whether, and by how much, an investment holding company chain (defined as each direct subsidiary and its own investments), is
impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount
rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the
outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Determination as to whether, and by
how much, an asset or CGU is impaired involves similar estimates.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be
determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data. Details of impairment charges recognized in the profit and loss
account and the carrying amounts of investments are shown in Note 2. The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2024 relating to
discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. It is impracticable to reliably determine the extent of any impacts of changes in the
assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the company’s investments given the diverse characteristics of the underlying assets and
the interdependency of the various inputs. Changes in the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and
circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within
the next financial year.

1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Discount rates
For discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted
using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the Company derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and
incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a
post-tax discount rate.
The discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2024, the post-tax discount rate was 8% (2023 8%) other than for
renewable power assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk, an additional premium of 1% to 3% was reflected in the
post-tax discount rate (2023 1% to 4%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various
economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for renewable power assets, typically ranged from 9% to 20% (2023 9% to 20%)
depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For renewable power assets, which were tested primarily
on a fair-value basis in 2024 (including those in equity accounted entities) tests were performed using a post-tax cost of equity-based discount rate range
of 8.75% to 9.5%. In 2023, tests were performed on a value-in-use basis using a post-tax WACC-based discount rate of 6.5%.
Oil and natural gas properties
For upstream oil and natural gas properties in subsidiaries, expected future cash flows are estimated using management’s best estimate of future oil and
natural gas prices, and production and reserves and certain resources volumes. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based
on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors. A
change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one
or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period.
Management consider that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/
or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year.
Oil and natural gas prices
The price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp’s carbon emissions cost
assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate
change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 145. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice
president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy
transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon
supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the
scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.
During the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing were revised. The revised price assumptions have been rebased in real
2023 terms and are materially consistent with the disclosed prices in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per
barrel to reflect near term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy
system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00
per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. These price assumptions are derived
from the central case investment appraisal assumptions (see page 20). A summary of the group’s revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub
gas, applied in 2024 and 2023, in real 2023 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management’s best estimate of future prices at the
balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line
with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. Inflation rate of 2% - 2.5% (2023 2%) is applied to determine the price
assumptions in nominal terms.
2024 price assumptions
2025 2030 2040 2050

Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu) 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00

Brent oil ($/bbl) 71 71 71 59 46
Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu) 4.06 4.05 4.05 4.05 4.05
Oil and natural gas reserves
In addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the Company’s estimated oil and
natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data,
reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the Company’s estimates of
its oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial
assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.
Reserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of
oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to
reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.

Financial statements
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentation currency of the financial statements is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional
currency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the
income statement. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.
Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by a non-US dollar functional currency branch are
translated into US dollars and are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Income statement
transactions are translated into US dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period.
Financial guarantees
The Company enters into financial guarantee contracts with its subsidiaries. The liability for a financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value
and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract’s estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate,
cumulative amortization.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The defined benefit pension plans are plans that share risks between entities under common control. In each instance BP p.l.c. is the principal employer
and carries the whole plan surplus or deficit on its balance sheet. The cost of providing benefits under the Company’s defined benefit plans is determined
separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service
cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan
amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately
when the company becomes committed to a change.
Net interest expense relating to pensions and other post-employment benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in
present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the
present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected
changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.
Remeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts
included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently
reclassified to profit and loss.
The defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of
the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations
are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit
pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions
to the plan.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.
Significant estimate: pensions and other post-employment benefits
Accounting for defined benefit pensions involves making significant estimates when measuring the Company's pension plan surpluses and deficits.
These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.
Pension assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at
the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the company’s balance sheet, and pension expense for the following year. The
assumptions used are provided in Note 4.
The assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these
variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and
net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying
amounts of the company’s pension obligations within the next financial year for the UK plan. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual
outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.
The values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation
used are provided in Note 4.
Income taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined
in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.

--- PAGE 260 ---
1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions – continued
Deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be realized in the future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled,
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not
discounted. See Note 6 for further details.
In July 2023, the UK government enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two Model rules. The legislation is effective for bp from 1 January 2024 and
includes an income inclusion rule and a domestic minimum tax, which together are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each
country in which bp operates. Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. In line with the amendments to IAS 12, the
exception from recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes has been applied.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through
profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as
set out below. The Company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have
been transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and
rewards of the asset have neither been retained nor transferred but control of the asset has been transferred.
Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash
flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective
interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired
and when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes receivables.
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the
date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value
through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities held by the Company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities include other payables,
accruals, and amounts payable to subsidiaries. The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
All financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is
typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated
by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation
of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.

At 31 December 2024, the carrying amount of the company’s net assets of $123.5 billion (2023 $123.6 billion) exceeded the group’s market capitalisation
of $79.6 billion (2023 $102.2 billion). As a result, management performed an impairment test of the company's major investments in line with the
requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Management considered the performance of investments and impairment tests performed by the
company’s subsidiaries. Taking into account the decrease in the group’s market capitalisation and an increase in the deficits between the carrying amount
of the company’s major investments compared with the underlying net assets, compared to 2023, management concluded that an impairment was
required, relating to deterioration of value in use and fair value less cost to sell. An impairment charge of $539 million were recognised against BP Global
Investments Limited. Notwithstanding that there have been certain impairment reversals within some of the groups operating subsidiaries during the year,
no reversals of previously recognised impairment provisions were determined to be required in respect of the company’s investments in subsidiaries.

4. Pensions
The defined benefit pension obligation consists primarily of a closed funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the
majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated
directors, four company-nominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is required
by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. Employees
in the UK are eligible for membership of defined contribution plans established with third-party providers.
The level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
For the primary UK defined benefit plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of
contributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2026 formal
actuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2024.
The surplus relating to the primary UK defined benefit plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any
remaining assets once all members have left the plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent
actuarial review was 31 December 2024. The primary UK defined benefit plan is subject to a formal actuarial valuation every 3 years. The most recent
formal actuarial valuation of the primary UK defined benefit plan was as at 31 December 2023.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below. The assumptions are reviewed by
management at the end of each year and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.
Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation %
2024 2023
Discount rate for plan liabilities 5.5 4.8
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.9 2.8
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.9 2.8
Inflation for plan liabilities 3.1 3.0
Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense %
2024 2023
Discount rate for plan other finance expense 4.8 5.0
The discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit
payments. The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. The
inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an
increase.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice
in the UK and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of
past longevity improvements into the future. For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows:
Mortality assumptions Years
2024 2023
Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.0 27.4
Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 28.9 29.2
Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.0 29.2
Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 30.5 30.6
The assets of the primary plan are held in a trust, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan. The
assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.
A proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In
order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios
are highly diversified.
The trustee’s long-term investment objective for the primary UK defined benefit plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same
way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI)
approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability
assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money
using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further
bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in
the table below.
For the primary UK defined benefit plan there is an agreement with the trustee to at least maintain the proportion of assets with liability matching
characteristics and review over time. During 2024, the asset allocation policy remained unchanged.

Sensitivity analysis
The discount rate, inflation and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one-percentage point change, in
isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2024 for the company’s plans would have had the effects shown in the table below. The effects
shown for the expense in 2025 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.

a The amounts presented reflect that the discount rate is used to determine the asset interest income as well as the interest cost on the obligation.
b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions.
One additional year of longevity in the mortality assumptions would increase the 2025 pension expense by $32 million and the pension obligation at
31 December 2024 by $580 million.

a The nominal amount of 8% cumulative first preference shares and 9% cumulative second preference shares that can be in issue at any time shall not exceed £10,000,000 for each class of preference
shares.
Voting on substantive resolutions tabled at a general meeting is on a poll. On a poll, shareholders present in person or by proxy have two votes for every £5
in nominal amount of the first and second preference shares held and one vote for every ordinary share held. On a show-of-hands vote on other resolutions
(procedural matters) at a general meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy have one vote each.
In the event of the winding up of the company, preference shareholders would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the preference shares,
plus an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium equal to the higher of (i) 10% of the capital paid up on the preference shares
and (ii) the excess of the average market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange during the previous six months over par value.
During 2024 the company repurchased 1,238 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of $7,127 million, including transaction costs of $38 million.
All shares purchased were for cancellation. The repurchased shares represented 7.4% of ordinary share capital. A further 176 million ordinary shares were
repurchased between the end of the reporting period and 14 February 2025, the latest practicable date before the completion of these financial
statements, for a total cost of $927 million of which $922 million has been accrued at 31 December 2024. The number of shares in issue is reduced when
shares are repurchased.

8. Capital and reserves
See statement of changes in equity for details of all reserves balances.
Share capital
The balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.
Share premium account
The balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.
Capital redemption reserve
The balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.
Merger reserve
The balance on the merger reserve represents the premium arising where the fair value of the consideration given is in excess of the nominal value of the
ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares where merger relief under the Companies Act applies..
Treasury shares
Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share
Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and by bp’s US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are
treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the
company and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest
unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are
recognized as assets and liabilities of the company.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of the foreign currency
branch. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income statement.
Profit and loss account
The balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the company.
The profit and loss account reserve includes $23,932 million (2023 $23,858 million), the distribution of which is limited by statutory or other restrictions.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 do not reflect the dividend announced on 11 February 2025 and which is expected to be
paid on 28 March 2025; this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ending 31 December 2025.
9. Financial guarantees and other contingencies
The company has issued guarantees to third parties and other bp subsidiaries in case of the failure, on the part of certain bp subsidiaries, to pay current
liabilities and obligations pertaining to business operations. The amounts guaranteed by the company, at 31 December 2024, for these arrangements is
$412 million (2023 $649 million). The company guarantees finance debt and lease obligations of certain bp group subsidiaries. Maturity dates vary and
guarantees will terminate on full payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. As of 31 December 2024, maximum guaranteed amounts pertaining to
debt and lease arrangements were $69,054 million (2023 $61,900 million). These maximum amounts are more than the actual guaranteed exposure of
due at the balance sheet date as well as more than remaining obligations under the guaranteed contracts. The recognised liability due to provided financial
guarantees was $854 million at the balance sheet date (2023 $865 million). The liability was included within Payables.
Performance under all the above guarantees would be triggered by a financial default of the guaranteed entity and, as such, are currently not expected to
have any material effect.

9. Financial guarantees and other contingencies – continued
As part of normal ongoing business operations and consistent with generally accepted industry practices, the company also executes contracts involving
standard indemnities and guarantees for the respective businesses in which bp operates as well as indemnities specific to transactions, including the sale
of businesses. This includes a guarantee of subsidiaries' liabilities under the Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states and bp and under
the settlement agreement with the Gulf states in relation to the Gulf of America oil spill. The company has also issued uncapped guarantees for certain
subsidiaries’ liabilities under the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee agreement relating to the Gulf of America oil spill. See Note 33 in the consolidated group
financial statements of BP p.l.c. for further information. The company regularly evaluates the probability of having to incur costs associated with these
indemnities and does not believe such matters will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flow.
The company believes that guarantees and other off-balance sheet commitments do not currently, nor could reasonably have in the future, a material
effect on its financial position, income and expenses, liquidity, investments or financial resources.
Subsidiary audit exemptions

at growing free cash flow, returns and long-term shareholder value. This strategy will see bp grow its upstream oil and gas business, focus its downstream
business, and invest with increasing discipline into the transition. It builds on bp’s distinct strengths and competitive advantages as an integrated energy
company. There are no impacts on these financial statements related to the strategy announcements in accordance with IAS 10 ‘Events after the reporting

a See Financial statements – Note 4 for further information.
b Restructuring charges are classified as adjusting items where they relate to an announced major group restructuring. A major group restructuring is a restructuring programme affecting more than one of
the group’s operating segments that is expected to result in charges of more than $1 billion over a defined period. 2024 includes charges for provisions arising from the groups transformation project that
was announced on 16 January 2024. 2022 includes release of provisions for the reinvent bp restructuring costs.
c Under IFRS bp marks-to-market the value of the hedges used to risk-manage LNG contracts, but not the contracts themselves, resulting in a mismatch in accounting treatment. The fair value accounting
effect includes the change in value of LNG contracts that are being risk-managed, and the underlying result reflects how bp risk-manages its LNG contracts.
d For further information, including the nature of fair value accounting effects reported in each segment, see page 355.
e 2024 includes a $508 million gain relating to the remeasurement of bp's pre-existing 49.97% interest in Lightsource bp, and $498 million relating to the remeasurement of certain US assets excluded from
the Lightsource bp acquisition (see Note 3 for further information). 2023 includes $1,140 million of impairment charges recognized through equity-accounted earnings relating to our US offshore wind
projects.
f 2022 includes a provision reversal relating to the change in discount rate on retained decommissioning provisions.
g 2024 includes $429 million of impairment charges recognized through equity-accounted earnings relating to our interest in Pan American Energy Group.
h For 2024, see Financial statements – Note 2 for further information.
i 2024 includes recognition of onerous contract provisions related to the Gelsenkirchen refinery. The unwind of these provisions will be reported as an adjusting item as the contractual obligations are
settled.
j 2023 primarily relates to charges related to the control, abatement, clean-up or elimination of environmental pollution and legal settlements. 2022 primarily reflects charges due to the annual update of
environmental provisions, including asbestos-related provisions for past operations, together with updates of non-Gulf of America oil spill related legal provisions.
k For more information see Financial statements – Note 1 Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions – Investment in Rosneft, and Note 17 – Investments in associates.
l All periods presented include the unwinding of discounting effects relating to Gulf of America oil spill payables and the income statement impact of temporary valuation differences related to the group's
interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management associated with finance debt. 2024 includes the unwinding of discounting effects relating to certain onerous contract provisions. 2023 and
2022 include the income statement impact associated with the buyback of finance debt.
m Includes certain foreign exchange effects on tax as adjusting items. These amounts represent the impact of: (i) foreign exchange on deferred tax balances arising from the conversion of local currency tax
base amounts into functional currency; and (ii) taxable gains and losses from the retranslation of US dollar-denominated intra-group loans to local currency.
n 2024 and 2023 include revisions to the deferred tax impact of the introduction of the UK Energy Profits Levy (EPL) on temporary differences existing at 31 December 2022 that are expected to unwind
before 31 March 2028. 2022 includes the deferred tax impact of the introduction of the EPL. The EPL increases the headline rate of tax to 78% (75% until 31 October 2024) and applies to taxable profits

from bp’s North Sea business made from 1 January 2023 until 31 March 2028. In October 2024 the UK government announced changes to the EPL including a 3% increase in the rate from 1 November
2024, the removal of the Levy’s main investment allowance and an extension to 31 March 2030. The changes to the rate and to the investment allowance were substantively enacted in 2024. The
extension of the Levy to 31 March 2030 was substantively enacted after 31 December 2024 and will result in a non-cash deferred tax charge of around $0.5 billion in the year ended 31 December 2025.
o 2023 and 2022 include a $146-million charge and a $505-million charge respectively for the EU Solidarity Contribution.

Proved reserves replacement
Total hydrocarbon proved reserves at 31 December 2024, on an oil
equivalent basis including equity-accounted entities, decreased by 8%
compared with 31 December 2023 (8% decrease for subsidiaries and 4%
decrease for equity-accounted entities). Natural gas decreased by 15%
(19% decrease for subsidiaries and 5% increase for equity-accounted
entities).
There was a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 72mmboe
within our US, Trinidad and North Africa subsidiaries.
The proved reserves replacement ratio« is the extent to which production
is replaced by proved reserves additions. This ratio is expressed in oil
equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to previous
estimates, improved recovery, and extensions and discoveries. For 2024,
the proved reserves replacement ratio excluding acquisitions and disposals
was 50% (47% in 2023 and 20% in 2022) for subsidiaries and equity-
accounted entities, 52% for subsidiaries alone and 37% for equity-
accounted entities alone. There was a net decrease (96mmboe) of reserves
due to lower gas and oil prices, primarily in our US subsidiaries, partly offset
by an increase in reserves in some of our PSAs in Azerbaijan.
In 2024 net additions to the group’s proved reserves (excluding production,
sales and purchases of reserves-in-place) amounted to 441mmboe
(391mmboe for subsidiaries and 50mmboe for equity-accounted entities),
through revisions to previous estimates including price, improved recovery
from, and extensions to, existing fields, and discoveries of new fields. The
majority of subsidiary additions were through revisions to previous
estimates and extensions to existing fields and discoveries of new fields,
where they represented a mixture of proved developed and proved
undeveloped reserves. The principal proved reserves additions in our
subsidiaries by region were in the US and the Middle East. The principal
reserves additions in our equity-accounted entities were in PAEG.
In January 2024 it was reported that the Oslo District Court had determined
that certain development permits granted by the Norwegian government
during 2023 were invalid. This includes development permits for two fields
in which Aker bp has an interest. The court’s decision is not final and could
