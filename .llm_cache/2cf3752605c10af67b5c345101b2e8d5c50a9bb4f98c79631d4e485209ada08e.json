  "answer": "Barclays highlighted several liquidity risks in 2024, including:\n\n1. The risk that the Barclays Bank UK Group may be unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or may lack the appropriate amount, tenor, and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets. This could lead to failure in meeting regulatory or internal liquidity requirements, or in making repayments of principal or interest as they fall due, as well as difficulties in supporting day-to-day business activities.\n\n2. Specific key liquidity risks include:\n   - Stability of the deposit funding profile: Deposits payable on demand or at short notice could be adversely affected if Barclays fails to maintain customer and investor confidence or due to competition in the banking industry.\n   - Impacts of market volatility: Adverse market conditions with increased volatility in asset prices could negatively impact liquidity through increased derivative margin requirements and/or wider haircuts when monetising liquidity pool securities, making liquidity management more difficult.\n\n3. The assessment of liquidity risk is comprehensive, covering all sources of liquidity risk across assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, including at regional and legal entity levels.\n\n4. Liquidity risk is managed by specialists using a range of risk management approaches such as limits, plan monitoring, and stress testing, conducted within the risk appetite and mandates set by the second line of defense.\n\nThese points collectively describe Barclays' liquidity risk profile and management approach as of 2024. \n\nSOURCE [1], [2] Barclays Annual Report 2024, pages 9, 52",
