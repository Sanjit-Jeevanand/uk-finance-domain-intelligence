  "answer": "Barclays identifies several liquidity\u2011related risks in its 2024 Annual Report. The group\u2019s liquidity risk is defined as the risk that it is unable to meet contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets. Key liquidity risks include:\n\n- **Stability of the deposit funding profile** \u2013 deposits payable on demand or at short notice could be adversely affected if the group fails to preserve the current level of customer and investor confidence or if competition in the banking industry increases.  \n- **Impacts of market volatility** \u2013 adverse market conditions, with increased volatility in asset prices, could negatively impact the group\u2019s liquidity position through increased derivative margin requirements and/or wider haircuts when monetising liquidity\u2011pool securities; it could also make it more difficult to access money markets and/or the terms on which the group can obtain market funding, potentially leading to increased costs of funding, wider credit spreads, triggering additional collateral or other requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements, or limits on the range of counterparties willing to enter into transactions.  \n- **Primary liquidity risks from the acquisition of Tesco Bank** \u2013 these relate to the deposit book and off\u2011balance\u2011sheet commitments in the form of available credit on credit cards.\n\nBarclays also notes **capital risk**, defined as the risk that the group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to meet regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments and stressed conditions, including risk from the group\u2019s pension plans.  \n\n**Sources**  \nSOURCE [1] \u2014 Barclays, Annual Report 2024, Pages 52\u201352  \nSOURCE [2] \u2014 Barclays, Annual Report 2024, Pages 52\u201352",
