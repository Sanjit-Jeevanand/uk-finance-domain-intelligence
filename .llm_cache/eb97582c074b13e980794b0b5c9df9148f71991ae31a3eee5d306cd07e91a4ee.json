  "answer": "Common funding and liquidity risks across UK banks in 2024 included:\n\n- Increased impairments due to stressed property prices affecting mortgage, unsecured lending (including credit cards), and commercial real estate portfolios.\n- Increased market volatility, particularly in currencies and interest rates, impacting the value of assets held for liquidity purposes.\n- Market confidence and depositor perceptions of banking fragility, which could increase the severity and speed of deposit outflows, thereby impacting liquidity positions.\n- Potential credit rating downgrades of parent entities or the UK sovereign, which could increase funding costs, reduce access to funding, widen credit spreads, and adversely affect interest margins and liquidity.\n- Stability risks in deposit funding profiles, where deposits payable on demand or short notice could be affected by loss of customer and investor confidence or competition in the banking industry.\n- Adverse market conditions causing increased derivative margin requirements and wider haircuts when monetising liquidity pool securities, negatively impacting liquidity positions.\n\nThese risks collectively highlight the challenges UK banks faced in maintaining stable funding and liquidity in 2024.\n\nSOURCE [1] Barclays Annual Report 2024, p.46  \nSOURCE [2] Barclays Annual Report 2024, p.52",
