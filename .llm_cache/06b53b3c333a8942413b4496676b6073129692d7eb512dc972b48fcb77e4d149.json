  "answer": "Yes, Barclays mentioned AI-related regulatory risks. The Barclays Bank UK Group operates in jurisdictions that have adopted or are considering laws regulating artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, the EU\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), which came into force on 1 August 2024, imposes rights and duties to ensure the safe and ethical deployment of AI. Additionally, the increased adoption of AI technologies, which rely on large amounts of data including personal information, has led to new laws and evolving interpretations of data protection laws by authorities worldwide. These regulatory developments could increase compliance costs and affect the Group\u2019s operations and product offerings. \n\nThus, Barclays acknowledges that AI-related regulatory changes pose risks including increased costs, operational changes, and potential impacts on product development and marketing. \n\nSources: Barclays, Annual Report 2024, pages 55, 158",
